Since our nation’s founding, discriminatory policies and laws have created an unequal system in which Black communities have had their civil rights and liberties denied and have been systemically locked out of opportunities in education, housing, employment, and more. 
 
Through our Systemic Equality agenda, we will use nationwide litigation, advocacy, and public education to advance laws and policies rooted in racial equity and end discriminatory policies, laws, and practices that have an outsized impact on Black communities. 
 
Help us in our fight to ensure all people have equal access to housing, voting rights, education, and more bylearning more, pledging your support, ordonating. When we have full and equal access to education, jobs, housing, voting rights and more, better futures are possible.

The implications of Connell v. CIA and how we’re holding the CIA accountable for its actions at the Guantánamo Bay military prison. 
 
For more than one hundred years, ACLU lawyers have been at the center of one history-making court case after
            another, participating in more Supreme Court cases than any other private organization. With attorneys
            nationwide, we handle thousands of cases each year on behalf of clients whose rights have been violated. 
 
Four families of transgender youth and two doctors have challenged an Arkansas law that would prohibit healthcare professionals from providing or even referring transgender young people for medically necessary health care. 
 
During the Trump administration, we filed over246 lawsuits. 
 
Fighting Back Against Voter Suppression in GeorgiaFollowing record turnout in recent elections, Georgia legislators passed a voter suppression law designed to make it harder for voters, especially voters of color, to cast a ballot. We’re suing. 
 
Defending Student Free SpeechBrandi Levy was just blowing off steam off campus when she posted an expletive message on Snapchat critical of her school and cheer team. She was suspended from her cheer team, but alongside the ACLU she sued to defend student free speech. We took the case all the way to the Supreme Court – and won. 
 
Protecting Abortion Access in FloridaOn behalf of several abortion providers, we are fighting against Florida’s senseless and harmful law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy and threatens to imprison doctors who provide care beyond that point. 
 
In its first year, the ACLU challenged the Palmer Raids, protecting immigrants and trade union members. 
 
The ACLU stood almost alone in denouncing the federal government’s internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps. 
 
The ACLU represented an interracial couple in the landmark Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia. The court ruled that state bans on interracial marriage were unconstitutional. 
 
The ACLU took a controversial stand for free speech by defending a Nazi group that wanted to march through the Chicago suburb of Skokie—where many Holocaust survivors lived. 
 
The ACLU won a landmark Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, affirming the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry. 
 
In a victory for privacy, the Supreme Court ruled in an ACLU case, Carpenter v. United States, that people’s sensitive cell phone location data is protected by the Fourth Amendment, requiring the government get a warrant to access it. 
 
We have over 1,700 staffers in every state, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico fighting for people's constitutional rights.
