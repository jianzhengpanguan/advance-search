GENERAL REIMBURSEMENT POLICY  
 
1.0 GENERAL  (0101) 
 
1.1 Overview  (010101) 
  DoD reimbursable authority is authorized by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Comptroller) (OUSD(C)), through budget formulation and statutory authorization of the budget in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, section 2205 ( 10 U.S.C. § 2205
). 
 1.2 Purpose (010102)   This chapter provides guidance on the amounts that must be recouped when 
DoD Components perform work or sell property within the Department, to other f ederal agencies 
and to private parties that do not involve the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) or other DoD Revolving Funds.  It does not provide authority to sell to private parties, since specific legal authority must be identified to make such sales.  It supplements the standards for financial 
accounting for intragovernmental accounts receivable in Volume 4, Chapter  3, for 
intragovernmental accounts payable in Volume 4, C hapter 9, and budgetary accounting for 
reimbursements, in Volume 3, Chapters 8 and 15.  1.3 Authoritative Guidance (010103) 
  1.3.1.  U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) authorized accounts are to be credited for reimbursements made to DoD appropriations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 1535
 and 
31 U.S.C. § 1536 .  Refer to 10 U.S.C. § 2205 for further guidance. 
  1.3.2.  Statutory authority on project order agreement s for work or material or for the 
manufacture of material pertaining to approved projects placed with a separately managed DoD- owned establishment  is given in 41 U.S.C. § 6307
.  31 U.S.C. § 1535 governs Economy Act  
orders  placed with an agency or major organizational unit within an agency.  Chapter s 2 and 3 
provide detailed guidance on the se statutory requirements . 
  1.3.3.  According to DoD I nstruction  (DoDI) 4000.19
 “Support Agreements,” 
DoD Components are responsible for programming, budgeting, and funding for the reimbursable 
support agreements into which they enter .  These include agreements into  which  a 
DoD Component enters into with another DoD Component;  a federal agency ; a state, local , or 
tribal government; or a non- governmental entity that is a congressionally chartered nonprofit 
organization pursuant to 36 U.S.C. §§ 20101 to 240101  (e.g., American Red Cross, Boy Scouts of 
America, Girl Scouts of the U .S., and United Service Organizations, Inc.) .  DoDI 4000.19 uses  the 
term Intra-agency support agreements to refer to agreements between DoD C omponents.  Also, 
DoDI 4000.19 uses  the term  Inter -agency support agreements to refer to agreements between 
DoD Components and f ederal agencies . 
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-4  1.3.4.  The Department will no longer provide non- reimbursable support of any kind to 
other f ederal, state, territorial, tribal, or local government entities; private groups and 
organizations; foreign governments; and international organizations.  Refer to the 
Secretary  of Defense Memorandum, " Reimbursable Activities in Support of Other Entities ," 
June 19, 2020 ( DoD Common Access Card  required) .  Non -reimbursable support may be provided 
if required by statute.  When discretionary non- reimbursable support is permitted but not required 
by statute , it must be  authorized by the DoD Joint Ethics Regulation or DoD Public Affairs 
guidance; or is provided after approval  of an exception.  Refer to the OUSD(C) m emorandum, 
"Reporting Guidance for Reimbursable Activities in Support of Other Entities ,” July 22, 2020 
(DoD Common Access Card  required ) for details on how to rec eive an exception.  
  1.3.5.  The requirements in Treasury Financial Manual 
(TFM) Volume  I, Part 2, Chapter 4700
, Appendix 8, “Sect ion 1—Buy/Sell Transactions ,” 
provides guidance  on Buy/Sell activity that involve reimbursable activity between 
Federal  Program Agencies (FPAs)  and, between FPAs and third -party providers.  These buyers 
and sellers are also known as trading partners.  The TFM  provides the business rules and processes 
to properly record, report, reconcile and measure  intra-governmental transactions (IGTs).  The 
TFM dif ferentiates between two types of IGTs, intra -departmental and intra -governmental.  
Intra -departmental transactions result from activity between trading partners within the same 
department.  Intra -governmental transaction s result from activity between f ederal agencies not 
within the same department.  The Volume 5, “ Definitions ” Chapter defines an FPA as a 
department, instrumentality, office, commission, board, service, or other establishment of the U.S. Government. 
  1.3.6.  Th e guidance in this  chapter is applicable unless a specific DoD issuance authorizes 
alternative reimbursement policies.  The most significant of these alternative reimbursement policies include:    1.3.6.1.  10 U.S.C. § 2571
 allows for the exchange or transfer  of supplies and 
services between military departments  without compensation.  Such  transfers of supplies between 
military departments must have the permission of the Service Secretaries involved.  In addition, a DoD Component may perform work, services or issue supplies without reimbursement, to another 
DoD Component with the permission of the respective C omponent heads.  Furthermore, costs of 
DoD military or civilian pay and allowances  (along with dependent and household goods 
transportation) for detail or other assignments, may be charged to an appropriation with the 
approval of the receiving DoD Component head. 
   1.3.6.2.  Volume 11B establishes the DoD guidance for the recovery of cost for 
products and services provided by the DWCF or other applicable DoD Revolving Fund activities.  Reimbursable orders placed with the DWCF or other DoD Revolving Fund activities may fall under any number of authorities (e.g. Project Orders for depot maintenance).  The basic transactional authority for the DWCF is derived from 10 U.S.C. § 2208(a)
.  This authority for 
buyer- seller transactions is not dependent on the Economy Act or Project Order Act statutes.  
See Volume 11B, for additional information regarding DWCF authorities. 
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-5   1.3.6.3.  Volume 13 establishes the DoD accounting guidance for 
DoD Morale,  Welfare, and  Recreation  (MWR) functions performed by 
Nonappropriated Fund instrumentalities  (NAFIs) .  DoD Components must not commingle 
Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs) with Appropriated Funds (APFs ), even when used to support a 
common program.  DoDI  1015.15 , “Establishment, Management, and Control of Nonappropriated 
Fund Instrumentalities and Financial Management of Supporting Resources ,” provides further 
guidance. 
 
  1.3.6.4.  Volume 15 establishes the DoD guidance for the 
Foreign Military  Sales  (FMS) of defense articles , defense services  and for providing military 
training  to allied and friendly  foreign governments and internationa l orga nizations.  Refer to 
Volume 15, Chapter 6, Appendix G (Columns 12 and 13) , for additional information on how to 
account for actual hours worked.  
   1.3.6.5.  DoD Directive  (DoDD)  3025.13
 “Employment of DoD Capabilities in 
Support of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS),” provides the DoD policy for the use of DoD resources for reimbursable support of the USSS, a DHS entity.  
   1.3.6.6.  DoDD 3025.18
 “Defen se Support of Civil Authorities,” provides the 
DoD policy for providing reimbursable military support when requested by civil authorities in order to save lives, prevent human suffering or, mitigate property damages within the U.S.  Refer to Chapter 19 for further guidance. 
   1.3.6.7.  DoDI 3025.21
 “Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies ,” 
provides the DoD policy for reimbu rsement when equipment or services are  provided to agencies 
outside DoD in  support of  civilian law enforcement officials.  
 2.0 REIMBURSEMENT GUIDANCE  (0102) 
 2.1 General Guidance (010201) 
  2.1.1.  A seller’s reimbursements are amounts earned and collected for materials sold or services furnished as a result of a reimbursable agreement.  A seller’s reimbursable obligations are financed by offsetting collections.  Components are to credit these offset ting collections to an 
expenditure account in payment for goods and services provided by that account.  Refer to Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular  A-11, section  20
 for further details.  Credit 
the specific appropriation or fund account for the collection only when it authorized by law. 
  2.1.2.  The TFM  in Volume I, Part 2, Chapter  4700, Appendi ces 5 and  8 provide the 
requirements for  accounting, reporting, and r econciliation of IGTs between F PAs and their trading 
partners.  The f ive IGT categories are Fiduciary, Buy/Sell, Transfers, Custodial , and General Fund 
transactions.  Buy/Sell IGTs involve transactions where goods or  services are purchased by one 
federal agency from another f ederal agency.  Buy/Sell IGTs are exchange transactions impacting 
assets and liabilities; revenue and expenses; and advances/prepayments and deferred credits .  Two 
federal agencies will usually execute a reimbursable agreement to formally document this 
arrangement.  Trading partners mu st have appropriate statutory authority, such as the 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-6 Economy Act, prior to engaging in an agreement for Buy/Sell transactions.  For Buy/Sell IGTs , 
the receiving agency is the buyer and the servicing agency is the seller.  Trading partners must 
reconcile  completed performance transactions at a minimum, on a quarterly basis to ensure both 
parties are in agreement.  The TFM provide s the requirements for using the standard 
Interagency Agreement  (IAA)  containing the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (FS) Form 7600A 
“United States Government General Terms and Conditions (GT&C) ” and FS Form 7600B 
“United  States Government Order Form .”  Treasury re quires the use of these two IAA forms to 
ensure the proper recording and reporting on IGT Buy/S ell transactions  unless, other guidance 
(such as OMB policy) require s a completed agreement  for certain IGT types, such as assisted 
acquisitions .  Refer to paragraph 010205 for specific guidance.   
 
 2.1.3.  Non -Economy Act orders for intra -governmental work and services should be 
executed in accordance with the detailed guidance provided in Chapter 18.  2.2 Disposition of Collections (010202) 
 
 2.2.1.  Collections must be credited  to the appropriation that procured the services or 
materiel being sold wh en specifically authorized by law  as required by sub paragraph  010201.A . 
  2.2.2.  Collections for unfunded costs such as labor of military personnel, depreciation  of 
capital assets  and interest , must be deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts unless otherwise provided for in this chapter or by other DoD issuances.   2.2.3.  C ollections received after an appropriation cancels must be deposited in 
Treasury  Account 3200, "Collections of Receivables from Canceled Accounts.”   Refer to 
Volume 4, Chapter 3 . 
  2.2.4.  Disposition of collections for FMS  must be in accordance with Volume 15. 
 2.3 Billing Standard  (010203) 
  2.3.1.  The price to be charged for goods and/or  services furnished by the Department 
depends on whether that good and/ or service is provided to, or for the benefit of a DoD Component, 
a non- DoD f ederal agency, a private party, or a FMS customer.  Therefore, the ordering 
DoD Component activity that requisitions or orders a good or service must inform the performing 
DoD activity of the identity of the intended recipient for the requisitioned goods or services.  
Volume 4, Chapter 3 requires that  the ordering activity must review all charges fro m the 
performing activity to ensure that amounts due are in agreement with the reimbursable order and are supported with a copy of the order or contract and evidence of performance.   2.3.2.  DoD Components performing work or services on a customer order must bill the 
ordering DoD Component, other f ederal agency, or the public f or earned reimbursements 
(performance of work or services, or delivery from inventory) within 30 calendar days after the month in which performance occurred.  The payment due date mu st not be more than 30 calendar 
days from the date of the invoice.  Bills rendered are not subject to audit by the customer prior to 
payment as required under 31 U.S.C. § 1535. 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-7  2.3.3.  The accurate reporting of reciprocal balances, and proper elimination of reciprocal 
activity between trading partners, requires accurate documentation of accounting events.  Imbalances occur when federal entities or trading partners are unable to account f or and reconcile 
differences when buying and selling goods and services.  Volume 6B, Chapter 13 provides guidance for trading partner exchange of data, eliminating intra -governmental  transactions from 
the DoD quarterly and annual financial statements, and providing Treasury elimination  
information for use in preparing the Government- wide financial statements.  
 2.4 Determining Amounts to be Reimbursed (010204)  
 DoD Components must adhere to the guidance in the following 14 categories 
(subparagraphs 010204.A – N) when determining amounts to be collected as reimbursements.  
Components may use alternative reimbursement rules described in this v olume and in other 
DoD issuances  as applicable. 
 * 2.4.1.  DoD Components providing prepaid or reimbursable support will require that cost information is quantifiable and provided to all parties.  In addition, support must only be 
reimbursable when  the specified support  increases the seller’s incremental  direct costs and the 
seller’s actual  indirect co sts of providing support .  A seller can waive reimbursement from buyers 
that use or benefit from available support when charges would be less than the anticipated expense of billing and disbursing funds.  DoD Components designated as a Combatant Command support agent will provide administrative and logistics support to Combatant Command headquarters and the subordinate unified command headquarters, as documented in agreements on a non-reimbursable basis, in accordance with DoDD 5100.03
 “Support of the Headquarters of 
Combatant and Subordinate Unified Commands .”  Refer to  DoDI  4000.19 for additional guidance . 
  2.4.2.  An order placed or agreement made under the Economy Act obligates an appropriation of the ordering entity.  The amount obligated is deobligated to the amount of costs incurred and billed by the performing entity before the end of the period of availability of the 
appropriation.  According to OMB Circular A -11 “ Section 20 - Terms and Concepts ,” the 
Economy Act allows f ederal agencies or DoD Components to do work for each other.  As the costs 
for this work are incurred, the Economy Act authorizes the collections to be credited directly to 
the expenditure account that provided the goods and services for reimbursement.  Refer to Chapter  3 for further details.  
  2.4.3.  A project order placed with, and accepted by a separately managed DoD -owned 
entity for services, material, or the manufacture of material, provide support for a valid and recordable obligation of the ordering entity.  Project order appropriations remain available to pay an obligation in the same manner as appropriations remain available to pay an obligation to a commercial manufacturer or private contractor.  Refer to Chapter 2 for further details.  
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-8  2.4.4.  As provided in Volume 13, Chapter 5 t he two mechanisms for providing APF 
support to NAFIs are via t wo MWR  functions.  The first is the Utilization Suppor t and 
Accountability (USA) , and the second is the Unifo rm Funding and Management (UFM) .  
MWR  USA enables NAFIs to use NAFs to execute such expenses, subject to subsequent 
APF reimbursement.  Record in the cash account with a contra entry to an Unearned Income 
(liability) account any MWR UFM funds received in advance.  Reduce the Unearned Income 
account for th e amount of MWR UFM expenses recorded.  
 
 2.4.5.  Direct Civilian Labor . 
   2.4.5.1.  A DoD Component must be reimbursed for direct civilian labor costs when performing a service or furnishing materials to another entity.  If the performing Component has appropriated funds for that purpose, then reimbursement is not required.    2.4.5.2.  DoD Components, other f ederal agencies, and the public must be charged 
for civilian labor performed for their benefit.  Calculate the costs by multiplying the actual hourly pay rates by the number of actual hours worked or assigned (detailed).  Charge full -time 
assignments (details) using annual rates.  Otherwise apply the hourly rate in accordan ce with 
Chapter 6, Appendix D.    2.4.5.3.  Civilian personnel fringe benefit rates must be comput ed in accordance 
with Chapter 6, Appendix C.  These rates are updated annu ally and published by 
OUSD(C),  Deputy Comptroller Program/Budget (P/B)  on the Financial Management Reports web 
page, listed by fiscal year (FY) under the DoD Reimbursable Rates
 heading.  Refer to  the 
Civilian  Personnel Fringe Benefit (Tab D).  
 
 2.4.6.  Direct Military Labor . 
 
  2.4.6.1.  A DoD Component must fund the cost of direct (and indirect) military labor incurred in the performance of a service for, or the furnishing of materials to, another DoD Component via applicable military personnel appropriations.  Therefore, the performing 
DoD Component must not charge the receiving DoD Component for reimbursement of the cost of 
military labor.  10 U.S.C. § 2571 authorizes t his exception to typical reimbursement requirements 
as outlined in 010103.F .1.  DoD Components must reimburse DWCF activities for the cost of 
military labor as prescribed  in Chapter 6, Appendix B and Volume 11B, Chapter 12.  
U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (USACE) military labor provided in support of civil works 
activities of the USACE via reimbursable agreement with  DoD organizations , and to non- DoD 
organizations through the Support for Others Program  must be charged in the same manner as 
military labor provided to non- DoD organizations.  The Support for Others Program is a 
reimbursable financing source that is report ed each year in the USACE Annual Financial Report.  
As an example, r efer to the  USACE FY 2020 Annual  Financial Report , Note 1 , section 1.D 
“Financing Sources .” 
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-9   2.4.6.2.  If provided for in the annual DoD Appropriations Act, operation and 
maintenance  appropriations, may be available for reimbursement of pay, allowances and other  
expenses for National Guard and Reserve members who provide intelligence or  
counterintelligence support to Combatant Commands, Defense Agencies and Joint Intelligence 
Activitie s.  These expenses  involve the activities and programs included within the 
National  Intelligence Program and the Military Intelligence Program.   Refer to the FY 2021  
OUSD(C), P/B guidance published online at Tab K under the subsection DoD Reimbursable Rate s. 
   2.4.6.3.  DoD Components must charge non -DoD organizations for military labor 
on the basis of the actual hours worked or assigned (detailed) , using the annual military composite 
standard pay rates.  Compute t he military personnel composite standard pay and reimbursement 
rates in accordance with Chapter 6, Appendix G .  OUSD(C) , P/B annually updates and published 
these rates online at Tab K under the subsection DoD Reimbursable Rates.
 
   2.4.6.4.  Military labor charged using the annual DoD composite rate for military 
labor includes a Medicare- Eligible Retiree Health Care accrual to cover the cost of health benefits 
for current officer and enlisted  personnel after they retire and become Medicare -eligible, as well 
as such costs for their dependents and annuitants.  The annual composite rate charged to non- DoD 
organizations includes an acceleration factor to cover medical health care costs of active d uty 
personnel and their dependents.  Military Services will furnish data in accordance with Chapter 6, Appendix G.
 
 
 2.4.7.  Temporary Duty Costs .  Travel costs incurred by DoD civilian employees and 
military personnel incurred in performance of a reimbursable work order must be charged as a 
direct cost when such travel can be identified specifically to the order.  Costs of supplies and other directly relatable expenses are also  chargeable.  
 
 2.4.8.  DoD Personal  Property and Inventory. 
   2.4.8.1.  According to DoDI  5000.64
 “Accountab ility and Management of 
DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property,” personal property includes  systems, 
equipment, materials, and supplies.  This does not include records of the Federal Government and real property (land and improvements to facilities).  Personal property normally expected to have a period of service of a year or more after being put into use meets the OMB Circular A -11 
equipment definition.  This equipment must be  without material impairment of its physical 
condition or functional capacity.  Personal property either held for sale, produced for sale, or used to produce goods for sale, or to provide a service for a fee, meets the OMB Circular A -11 inventory 
definition.
 
   2.4.8.2.  Reutilization and Marketing Materiel (Surplus)     2.4.8.2.1.  DoD Manual 4160.21
, Volume  1 “Defense Materiel 
Disposition:  Disposal Guidance and Procedures,” defines a surplus as excess personal prop erty 
no longer required by the f ederal agencies , as determined by the General Services  Administration.  
The disposition of materiel by a Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office must be in accordance 
with this DoD Manual .  The accounting treatment is set forth in Volume 4, Chapter 4. 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-10    2.4.8.2.2.  The general rules for the disposition of proceeds from the sale of 
scrap or excess personal property must be in accordance with Chapter 5.  
  2.4.8.3.  Non -DWCF Materiel.   The pricing of persona l property for non- DWCF 
materiel depends on whether the item(s) being transferred or sold will be transferred to another DoD Component and would normally be replaced.  DoD Components make this determinatio n in 
accordance with the approved acquisition obje ctive , according to  
OMB  Circular  A-25 
“User  Charges.”   If the sale will reduce assets required to meet the approved acquisition objective , 
then replacement is required.  
 
   2.4.8.3.1.  Issues within or to another DoD Component  with the exception 
of issues in support of NAFI Category C activities and USACE civil works activities,  must be on 
a non- reimbursable basis  as provided in 10 U.S.C. § 2571.  Such issues  will require an accounting 
entry to reflect the transfer from the losing to the gaining activity.  The accounting entry must reflect original acquisition cost and any accumulated depreciation.  Issues in support of NAFI  Category C activities and USACE civil works activities must be priced in the same manner 
as issues to other f ederal agencies and private parties as provided in 010204.H.3.b. 
    2.4.8.3.2.  Issues to other f ederal agencies  or private parties must be priced 
as follows:  
    2.4.8.3.2.1.  Materiel to be Replaced . 
      2.4.8.3.2.1.1.  Materiel, including equipment, for which replacement (i.e., similar, but not exact) or replacement in -kind (i.e., exact) is required, must be 
transferred or sold at the estimated replacement cost, including the contract or production costs of the article less an adjustment for age and condition of the item being sold.  This price is determined in three steps.  First , determine the normal useful peacetime life of the item or equipment to be 
sold.  Second, determine the percentage of useful life remaining on the item.  Third, apply the percentage to the estimated (or actual) cost of the replacement item.  The resultant amount is the base cost t o be used in the sale price calculation.  Under no condition must the sale price be less 
than the scrap value plus the cost of the last major overhaul or outfitting accomplished within 24 months before the sale.       2.4.8.3.2.1.2.  If it is imperative th at the item be replaced 
through accelerated procurements and normal pricing policies will not adequately recoup replacement costs, an exception to DoD pricing policies must be requested from OUSD(C) , P/B.  
Normally, the exception would be to either add a r eplacement factor or delay final pricing until 
the contract for replacement items is financially complete.  
 
    2.4.8.3.2.2.  Materiel Not to be Replaced .  A DoD Component that 
transfers or sells material, including equipment, to other federal  agencies and  private parties must 
do so at their original acquisition cost, net of any accumulated depreciation/amortization  
(i.e., net book value) .  If the DoD Component cannot reasonably ascertain those amounts, the cost 
of the material  will be its fair value at the time of transfer  as provided in Volume 4, Chapter 25. 
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-11  2.4.9.  Contracts.  
 
  2.4.9.1.  Contract costs incurred for contracts awarded as part of a reimbursable agreement must be billed to the benefiting organization.  
  2.4.9.2.  Government- furnished materiel must be billed in addition to contract costs 
in accordance with subparagraph 010204.H.  
   2.4.9.3.  If the contract is provide d to meet the requirements of a non-f ederal 
organization, the contractor must be required to pay rent (at fair market value) to the Department 
for the costs incurred for the use of plant or production equipment utilized in manufacturing the item being sold . 
   2.4.9.4.  The Federal  Acquisition  Regulation Subpart 52.232-17
, “Interest,” 
provides that all amounts that become payable under the contract must bear simple interest from 
the due date until paid, unless paid within 30 days of becoming due.  The Treasury’s Bureau of  the 
Fiscal Service provides an online “ Simple  Daily  Interest  Calculator ” for payments less than 
31 days old and a monthly compounding interest calculator for payments more than a month late.  
   2.4.9.5.  Contract administration charges must be charged to other f ederal a gencies 
and private parties, in accordance with  statutory or policy requirements.  As allowed in 
10 U.S.C. § 2571 contract administration costs are not to be charged within a DoD Component or to another DoD Component  (with the exception of support to NAFI Category C activities and 
support provided to USACE civil works activities ) when funding for such costs is  included in the 
mission funding of the performing DoD entity.  Contract administration charges for support to NAFI Category C activit ies and support provided to USACE civil works activities must be priced 
in the same manner as charges to other federal agencies and private parties.  
 
  2.4.9.6.  DoD personnel services in support of contracts must be costed in 
accordance with subparagraphs 010204.E and 010204.F.  
 
 2.4.10.  Accessorial Charges.  
   2.4.10.1.  The “Glossary ” Chapter defines these as costs incurred for packing, 
crating, and handling related to sales or shipments of property.  Accessorial charg es may be 
incurred by the DoD for direct delivery of items from contractor facilities or by DoD Components for items furnished f rom DoD stocks.  Accessorial expenses  for support provided to USACE civil 
works activities must be priced in the same mann er as charges to other f ederal agencies and private 
parties.
 
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-12   2.4.10.2.  Unless otherwise provided by law or regulation, accessoria l charges must 
be billed to the following: 
    2.4.10.2.1.  Non -DoD f ederal departments, agencies, or instrumentalities.  
    2.4.10.2.2.  Non -federal entiti es, including DoD contractors. 
    2.4.10.2.3.  N AFIs when property is transported for DoD MWR  activities 
unless reimbursement has been waived by DoDI 1015.15.     2.4.10.2.4.  USACE for civi l works projects or activities.  
   2.4.10.3.  Accessorial charges must be reimbursed by non- DoD activities for the 
actual cost incurred and billed.
 
 
 2.4.11.  Asset Use Charge.  A charge for the use of DoD assets (facilities and equipment, 
or both) is required to recoup depreciation and interest on investment.  In accordance with 
OMB  Circular  A-25 section  9.A, a mounts collected must be returned to the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts, unless otherwise provided for by statute or other DoD guidance.  An asset use charge is a factor added to the base rate to recoup depreciation and interest on investments for use of  DoD facilities and equipment.  A four percent charge  may be used.  This rate is published 
annually by OUSD(C) , P/B.  Refer to the DoD Reimbursable Rates (Tab E)  for details .  
Alternatively , the following calculations may  be performed:  
   2.4.11.1.  Depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of the recorded cost 
of facilities and equipment (less its estimated salvage or residual value), as an operating expense 
over the period in which these assets are expected to provide benefits  or the es timated useful life , 
whichever is shorter .  Depreciation must be charged using the straight -line method of depreciation.  
A general equipment or real property item with a recorded cost that equals or exceeds the applicable capitalization threshold and has a useful life of at least two years must be capitalized as an asset and depreciated over its useful life.  See Volume 4,  Chapter  25.  The depreciation 
calculation is illustrated in Exhibit 1-1.
 
   2.4.11.2.  Interest expense must be included in reimbursement  billings to private 
parties to recognize the interest on investment in fixed assets when such assets are acquired or manufactured for the purpose of, or prepared for use in, providing materiel to private parties.  The calculation of interest on investme nt is illustrated in Exh ibit 1-2.
 
 
 2.4.12.  Repair and Maintenance.  When repair and/or maintenance of items occurs, costs 
from a cost accounting system or, in its absence, equivalent costs developed through cost - finding 
techniques must be billed. 
 
  2.4.12.1.  Labor cost must be computed in accordance with 
subparagraphs 010204.E and 010204.F.  
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-13   2.4.12.2.  Materiel and Supplies cost must be computed in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.H.  
 
  2.4.12.3.  Transportation and related costs  must be computed in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.J.  
 
  2.4.12.4.  Overhead Cost  must be computed in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.N.  
 
 2.4.13.  Leased or Loaned DoD Equipment.  When determining the charge for leased or 
loaned equipment, the following elements must be billed: 
 
  2.4.13.1.  Depreciation is not applicable to federal agen cies unless the billing 
activity is a D WCF.  Depreciation must be based on cost -finding technique s for sales to private 
parties unless actual rates are known.  Calculations must be in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.K.  
 
  2.4.13.2.  Interest on investment in assets must be computed in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.K and as designated within the lease agreement . 
 
  2.4.13.3.  Value of equipment not returned to the owning DoD Component must be 
a sale to the using organization.  This sale must be priced in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.H.  
 
  2.4.13.4.  Accessorial expenses must be recognized in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.J.  
 
  2.4.13.5.  Repair costs to restore equipment or property to its condition at the time leased or loaned must be collected from the using organization.  The amounts must be based on 
either actual job order cost accumulations or estimates of the cost to be incurred based upon past repair and maintenance experience for similar equipment.  The amounts collected must be returned 
to the appropriation that financed the repair and maintenance  in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2667
. 
 
  2.4.13.6.  Direct labor costs must be computed in accordance with 
subparagraphs 010204.E and 010204.F ; materiel and supply costs must be computed in accordance 
with subparagraph 010204.H ; and overhead mu st be computed in accordance with 
subparagraph 010204.N.  
  2.4.14.  Overhead.    2.4.14.1.  Overhead i nvolve expenses necessary to run a business that are not 
directly tied to the production and delivery of goods or services, according to OMB  Circular  A- 11. 
   2.4.14.2.  Overhead is typically referred to as general and administrative  (G&A) 
costs or some combination of G&A and indirect costs which cannot readily or directly be identified to the performance of a specific customer order  for reimb ursable costing.  Examples of such costs  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-14 include central management, rent for office space, human resources, sales, building maintenance , 
office supplies  and utility costs.  As provided by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board  
(FASAB) in  FASAB  Technical  Release 15  that clarifies Statement of Federal Financial 
Accounting Standards  6, when  accumulated indirect costs are not identified as costs incurred to 
bring facilities and equipment to a form and location suitable for its intended use , they should be 
expensed. 
 
  2.4.14.3.  DoD Components may use materiality to determine whether overhead 
costs should be included in reimbursable billings.  This determination must be justified , 
documented, and be able to stand up to audit scrutiny.  If an organization has a material  amount of 
reimbursable effort, overhead  costs are accumulated in a cost pool and allocated to customers.  In 
the absence of a cost accounting system, applicable cos ts may be estimated.  
   2.4.14.4.  Overhead charges may not be applied to reimbursable customer orders 
received from APF activities within the Department.  However, APF  activities will charge 
overhead on sales to other f ederal agencies , NAFI Category C activities, USACE civil works 
activities  and private parties.
 
 *2.5 Documentation Standards (010205)  
 2.5.1.  General .  Support agreements must comply with generally accepted government 
auditing standards as required in 31 U.S.C. § 3521  “Audits by agencies.”   These standards require 
establishing internal controls that provide reasonable assurance of achieving effective and efficient operations, compliance with regulations and applicable laws, and reliability of financial reporting.   
Support agreements must contain documentary evidence as required in 
31 U.S.C. § 1501  
“Documentary evidence requirement for Government obligations .”  Such evidence must include a  
purpose or scope of agreement in writing as authorized by law.  Thes e agreements  must be 
executed before obligational availability expires and prior to the initiation of reimbursable fund 
certification . 
   2.5.1.1.  A s upport agreement with a term greater than 3 years must be reviewed 
and validated by a support agreement manager from the buyer and seller.  This review and validation must occur  by at least th e mid-point of the effective date (e.g., at year 4 in an 8- year 
agreement) .  Support agreements expire at a maximum 10 years from the effective date unless 
there is legal authority for the agreement to continue beyond 10 years.    2.5.1.2.  New signatures from all parties to the agreement are required to establish a new support agreement or modify an existing support agree ment .  This must take place  even 
when the term s and conditions are the same as those in the prior agreement.  Cost estimates within 
agreements that include reimbursable support services must be  reviewed annually by the selle r to 
ensure current year actual costs are identified for accurate customer billing and invoices.    2.5.1.3.  Support agreements that are active and have established terms for payment in effect as of December 16, 2020 will be converted to FS  Form 7600A.  This conversion must 
occur  upon the agreement’s next scheduled review or 3 years from December  16, 2020, whichever 
comes first.  Refer to DoDI  4000.19 for additional guidance. 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-15   2.5.1.4.  Support agreements must include procedures for amending, terminating, 
reviewing, and transferr ing the agreement ; and for dispute resolution.  For example , the agreement  
must specify that termination may occur  by either party via written notice to the other party 
following an agreed upon termination  time .  Reporting entities unable to reach an agreement with 
respect to intragovernmental account balances must escalate the issue to the OUSD(C) , 
Financial  Improvement and Audit Remediation (FIAR) Directorate for resolution.  Submit 
requests to the FIAR Directorate no later than the 12th business day of the month following the end of the quarter.  At fiscal year -end, final adjustments must be completed prior to the issuance 
of the Agency Financial Report.   Refer to Volume 6B, Chapter 13 for details. 
 
 2.5.2.  FS  Forms 7600A/B.  The TFM defines trading partner s as two entities engaged in 
IGT activity .  Components must use FS Forms 7600A/B for intra -governmental Buy/Sell  
transactions.  FS  Form 7600A should cover the broadest categories of goods and services agreed 
to by both trading partners and, where practical, consolidate requirements to reduce the agreement workload until DoD Enterprise Resource Planning financial systems are capable of  processing 
FS Form 7600B or equivalent. 
  2.5.3.  Principal Documents.  The DoD Financial Statement Audit  Guide
, published 
May 2018 (DoD Common Access Card required ), allow the se Key Supporting D ocuments for 
Reimbursable Work Orders : 
   2.5.3.1.  FS  Form 7600A, GT&C  (refer to DoDI 4000.19 and the TFM , Volume I, 
Part 2, Chapter 4700, Appendix 8 “Section 1 - Buy/Sell Transactions,” for further guidance).    2.5.3.2.  FS  Form 7600B, Order  Form  (refer to DoDI 4000.19 and the TFM , 
Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 4700, Appendix 8 “Section 1 - Buy/Sell Transactions,”  for further 
guidance).    2.5.3.3.  The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA ) (see  DoDI 4000.19  for further 
guidance).    2.5.3.4.  Standard Form ( SF) 1080
, Voucher for Transfers Between 
Appropriations and/or Funds. 
   2.5.3.5.  SF 1081
, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawal and Credits. 
 
 2.5.4.  Preparation Standards .  The following apply to document preparation: 
   2.5.4.1.  FS  Forms 7600A/B.  A Buy/Sell agreement that defines the terms, 
conditions, scope, and responsibilities for trading partners during the exchange is referred to as the GT&C ( FS Form 7600A).  To begin the agreement process, either a buyer or seller may originate 
a GT&C that must be completed and approved to create an order  (FS Form 7600B) .  The o rder 
must reference  an open GT& C; however, f ederal agencies do not have to complete a GT&C each 
time the y do a related order.  Federal agencies may complete just one GT&C for multiple years to 
cover multiple orders.  With the GT&C,  data is exchanged for approval and a broad range of 
transactions; in general no funds are transferred and no accounting entries are created. 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 1  
* May 2021 
1-16    2.5.4.1.1.  The Volume 5, “Definitions” Chapter defines G -Invoicing as an 
online portal that supports the exchange of information in IGT activity by federal trading partners.  
G-Invoicing will assign a unique identifier for each GT&C for tracking purposes.  Federal a gencies 
maintain the ability to associate their own unique identifier to each GT&C in their internal accounting systems.  Orders in G -Invoicing must reference an active GT&C.   G- Invoicing serves 
as a gateway for f ederal entities to agree upon the funding terms and the accounting treatment of 
their reimbursable activity, and exchange that data for consistent financial reporting.     2.5.4.1.2.  The order section of the Buy/Sell agreement ( FS Form 7600B) 
specifies the terms, quantities and prices, accounting data, and actions of each trading partner under 
the overarching GT&C.  It serves  as the funding section of the a greement that creates a fiscal 
obligation and details the necessary products/services requirements.  Funding information is 
provided for both trading partners, and all required points of  contact sign to authorize the order.  It 
communicates the Treasury Account Symbol/Business Event Type Code  for each o rder 
Schedule Line and contains unique lines of accounting or other accounting data.  The order will also identify the specific requirements of the buyer for the expected delivery of products or services by the s eller.  In addition, the o rder identifies the roles and responsibilities for both trading partners 
to ensure effective management of the o rder and use of the related funds. 
    2.5.4.1.3.  Treasury ’s Bureau of the  Fiscal Service will eventually require 
all FPAs to use G -Invoicing under the authority of  31 U.S.C. § 3512(b)  and 31 U.S.C. § 3513
, and 
in accordance with the TFM .  FPAs must implement G -Invoicing for new orders  by October 1, 
2022 and for “In -Flight” Orders by October 1, 2023.  Refer to the TFM , Volume I, Part 2, 
Chapter  4700, Appendix 8 for details. 
   2.5.4.2.  MOA.  An MOA is used to  document an agreement and execute or deliver 
support with or without reimbursement between two or more  parties.   When a support agreement 
involves reimbursement, it can be used to further detail  terms and conditions in addition to the 
FS Form 7600A .  A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  must only be used when there is 
agreement, among two or more parties, that payment is not expected; and when  the parties do not 
rely on each other to execute or deliver on any responsibilities.  Figure s 1 and 2 in DoDI  4000.19 
provide examples of  an MOA and MOU respectively . 
   2.5.4.3.  SF 1080.  Intra -governmental payments result from transactions between 
federal entities for sales, services, or transfers between such entities.  DoD Components may  use 
the SF 1080 voucher as support for bills to other DoD Components and non- DoD f ederal agencies 
when  unable to utilize electronic data interchange methods.  S ee Chapters 2, 9, 16 and Volume 10, 
Chapter 10.    2.5.4.4.  SF 1081.  DoD Components may use the SF 1081 voucher when a manual process is required to generate inter -agency payments and co llections with non -DoD f ederal 
agencies.   See Volume 10, Chapter 10.

* May 2021 
1-17 Exhibit 1-1 STRAIGHT -LINE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION  
 
EXAMPLE OF STRAIGHT -LINE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION  
 
Acquisition cost of the asset $1,000,000 
Less:  Residual value (scrap)  $   100,000 
Depreciable basis  $   900,000 
 
Estimated useful life in years  20 
 
The annual depreciation expense of $45,000 is computed by dividing the $900,000 
depreciable basis by the 20- year useful life.  
 
Hourly charge is computed by dividing the annual depreciation expense of $45,000 by 2,080 (standard yearly hours) to arrive at $21.63 per hour. 
 
Note: the standard 40-hour work week x the standard 52 weeks in a year = standard yearly 
hours. 
 
Multiply the hours used to complete the customer order by the hourly charge.  For example,  500 hours x $21.63 = $10,815 depreciation expense to be charged. 
   Exhibit 1-2 INTEREST ON INVESTMENT CALCULATION  
 
EXAMPLE OF INTEREST ON INVESTMENT CALCULATION  
 
Acquisition cost of the asset $1,000,000 
Less:  Accumulated depreciation ( 5 years at $45,000 per year)                      $   225,000 
Net Book Value $   775,000 
 
Annual interest ( assume a rate of 10 percent per annum in this instance ) $     77,500 
 
Hourly charge is computed by dividing the annual interest of $77,500 by 2,080 (standard yearly hours) to arrive at $37.26 per hour.  
 
Note: the standard 40-hour work week x the standard 52 weeks in a year = standard yearly 
hours. 
 
Multiply the hours used to complete the customer order by the hourly charge.  For example,  500 hours x $37.26 = $18,630 interest on investment to be charged.

of the United States Government 
 *2.0 DEFINITIONS  (0202) 
 2.1 Project Order  (020201) 
  41 U.S.C. § 6307 provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with the authority to place 
an order or contract for work, material, or the manufacture of material pertaining to an approved project from Federal Government -owned and operated activities.  USCG has similar project order 
authority contained in 14 U.S.C. § 712  to accept orders from, and enter into reimbursable 
agreements with, establishments, agencies, and departments of the DoD.   These Project Orders must be for “non -severable” work or service, which are separate and 
distinct from the Economy Act Orders discussed in Chapter  3.  When placed with, and accepted 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-5 by a separately managed DoD -owned establishment or the USCG, the project order serves to 
obligate an appropriation(s) in the same manner as an order or contract  with a commercial 
enterprise.  The appropriations related to project orders remain available to pay the obligation to a 
DoD- owned establishment or the USCG just as appropriations remain available to pay an 
obligation to a commercial manufacturer or private contractor.  
 
2.2 DoD-owned Establishment (020202) 
  A “DoD- owned establishment” for the purpose of this chapter is any DoD -owned and 
operated activity (that is, not contractor owned or operated) .  Such activities include working 
capital fund activities; other revolving fund activities; and those appropriated fund activities engaged in reimbursable operations that reasonably are not severable into fiscal year segments and where such operations can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy.  Examples of such a ctivities 
include e quipment overhaul or maintenance shops, manufacturing or processing plants or shops, 
research -and-development laboratories, computer software design activities, testing facilities, 
proving grounds owned and operated by the Department, and engineering and construction activities.   
 2.3 Contractual Relationship and Commercial Contracts  (020203) 
  Terms such as “contractual relationship,” and “commercial contracts,” are used to indicate 
the close relationship between project orders and commercial contracts in the particular circumstances involved.  The use of these and similar terms do not subject  project orders to the 
provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation , project order agreement, or responsibilities 
(legal or otherwise) not provided for in this chapter.  2.4 Allotment (020204) 
  Per Office of Management and Budget Circular A -11, a llotmen ts are subdivisions of 
apportionments that are made by the heads of agencies to incur obligations within a prescribed amount.  For the purposes of this chapter, subdivision includes the approved operating budgets for 
the operation of the Military Departments . 
 2.5 Approved Projects (020205)   As interpreted by GAO , the term “approved projects” simply refers to projects approved 
by officials having legal authority to do so.  3.0 GENERAL POLICY (0203) 
 *3.1 Treasury Guidanc e on Intra -Governmental Transactions (020301) 
  3.1.1.  Section 4708, “Intra -governmental Quarterly and Year -end Requirements,” of the 
1-TFM  2-4700 discusses the requirements necessary to properly report intragovernmental 
transactions resulting from business activities (i.e., buy/sell  transactions ) between two federal 
government entities, called trading partners.  It further references the Appendix 5, “ Overall 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-6 Intragovernmental Transaction Processes/General Information” to properly record, report, and 
reconcile intragovernmental transactions, including the processes for dispute resolution.   3.1.2.  Appendix 8 to Section 4708 provides guidance concerni ng reimbursable activity 
between trading partners, otherwise referred to as buy/sell activity.  Buy/sell activity and the associated accounting activities must be agreed upon by the trading partners and managed through a formal buy/sell agreement.  The TFM  provides the requirements for using the standard 
Interagency  Agreement (IAA
) containing Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service 
(FS) Form  7600A “General Terms and Conditions (GT&C) ” and FS Form 7600B  “Order 
Requirements an d Funding Information (Order)” .  The data elements captured in these forms are 
necessary to (1) ensure the proper recording and reporting on intragovernmental buy/sell 
transactions, and (2) eliminate most of the federal -wide reporting deficiencies impactin g the 
Financial Report of the United States Government. 
  3.1.3.  The Treasury's G -Invoicing
 system will be used as a gateway by all federal entities 
to agree upon the funding terms and the accounting treatment of their reimbursable activity, and exchange th e data with one another for consistent financial reporting.  Key changes from manual 
processes include a new set of data standards and the electronic submission of necessary documentation.  The mandated implementation deadline f or “new orders” is FY  2023.  The 
mandated implementation deadline for “in -flight” orders, which includes the conversion of orders 
with an open balance and a period of performance extending beyond September  30, 2023 is 
FY 2024.  
 3.2 Recordable Obligation (0 20302) 
  3.2.1.  A project order is a valid and recordable obligation of the issuing entity when the order is placed with and accepted by a separately managed DoD -owned  establishment or the 
USCG, providing the obligation otherwise meets the criteria for recordation of an obligation contained in 31 U.S.C. § 1501.   3.2.2.  All orders or contracts for work or material or for the manufacture of material pertaining to approved projects placed with DoD -owned establishments or the USCG must be 
considered as obligations in the same manner as prescribed for similar orders or contracts placed with commercial manufacturers or private contractors.  Appropriations remain available to pay the 
obligations so created as in the case of contracts or orders with commercial manufacturers or private contractors.  
 3.3 Project Order Form s (020303) 
 
 3.3.1.  As stated in paragraph 020301.B , Treasury has established a standard Interagency 
Agreement form containing the GT&Cs ( FS Form  7600A) and the Order ( FS Form  7600B) for 
federal -wide use in carrying out buy/sell transactions between trading partners.  These forms must 
be issued by an authorized DoD or USCG entity and accepted for performance in a DoD -owned 
and operated establishment. 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-7  3.3.2.  To properly document that the order for goods or services is a project order , the 
trading partners must ensure the proper statute (41 U.S.C. § 6307) is cited on the FS Form  7600B 
for DoD project orders, or  14 U.S.C. § 712 for USCG- related project orders . 
 
3.4 Work Description  (020304) 
  A project order must include an adequate description of the goods to be delivered and/or 
work to be performed, to incl ude the Line Item/Sub -Line Item level, as well as, the Product Service 
Code on each requirement.   Without these required elements , the order is not sufficient to create a 
recordable obligation or document detailed performance/delivery, receipt and acceptance, and its’ respective invoicing and settlement.  (Note:  There may be repeat orders for which the perfo rming 
installation has  detailed and definite specifications available.  Thus, if the performing activity has 
on file those elements that make a project order specific, definite, and certain, and those elements are in sufficient detail to enable the performing installation to proceed in carrying out the work ordered, then it is not necessary to also include those elements within the project order itself.  In such cases, reference may be made on the project order that specification documentation is retained on file by the performing activity.)  3.5 Use of Standard Line of Accounting (020305)   In accordance with Volume 1, Chapter 4 “Standard Financial Information Structure”, 
buyers and sellers must use the Standard Line of Accounting ( SLOA)  and ensure it is  properly 
annotated when generating or accepting a reimbursable order, as applicable.  Refer to Volume 1, Chapter 4 for additional details and requirements.  4.0 ADVANCE PLANNING (0204) 
 *4.1 Work Estimates to Performing DoD Establishments  (020401) 
  Ordering DoD Components or the USCG must give performing DoD -owned 
estab lishments advance planning notice of future requests of goods and/or services expected to be 
placed with the performing DoD -owned establishment.   A performing DoD -owned establishment, 
in the development of its operating budget, must use this advance planning detailed line/sub -line 
item level data to draft order requirements .  An operating budget is subject to revision as 
subsequent specific work requirements, including significant revisions thereof, are determined.  4.2 Cost Estimates  (020402) 
  At the appropriate time during project order negotiations, performing DoD -owned 
establishments must give ordering DoD Components cost estimates for each item to be produced or work to be perf orme d under the project order.

* May 2021 
2-8 5.0 CONDITIONS GOVERNING ISSUANCE AND ACCEPTANCE OF PROJECT 
ORDERS  (0205) 
 
5.1 Contractual Relationship  (020501) 
  A contractual relationship must exist (i.e., be created by the project order) between the 
parties involved.  5.2 Under the Same Activity Commander (020502)   Since an  entity  may not enter into a formal contract with itself, a project order must not be 
used by one organizational unit to order work from another organizational unit under the same activity commander.  
 5.3 Expiration (020503)   Expiration dates of project orders must not extend beyond the point in time in which the 
appropriation funding the order cancels (generally five years after the appropriation expires for new obligations).  5.4 DoD-Owned Establishment (020504) 
 
 Project orders must be issued only to DoD -owned establishments (see  definition in 
paragraph 020201) that have been given the authority to operate a reimbursable program in an amount equal to or exceeding the project order  amount(s).  Those issued to the USCG under 
14 U.S.C. § 712 would be issued in accordance with USCG established regulations.  To determine 
whether the project order statute provides the statutory authority for an intra -DoD order, determine 
whether the order is being placed with a DoD-owned establishment.  Also, determine whether the 
order is “entire” (also known as non- severable) under paragraph 020509 and satisfies the other 
requirements identified in this chapter. 
 5.5 Payment s (020505) 
  All payments mad e by an ordering DoD Component to a performing DoD -owned 
establishment must be based upon the  payment schedule in the approved and accepted order 
(FS Form 7600A) which must be within the scope and conditions of the established agreement 
(FS Form 7600B).  
 5.6 Specific, Definite, and Certain  (020506) 
  Project orders are analogous to contracts placed with commercial concerns and similar to 
such contracts, must be specific, definite, and certain both as to the work encompassed by the order and the terms of the order itself.  A project order must be accepted by the performing entity as a 
basis of obligation by the issuer.   
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-9 5.7 Certification of Availability for Purpose (020507) 
  Project orders are subject to the same fiscal limitations that are contai ned within the 
appropriation from which they are funded.  On the other hand, the performing entity may not be 
aware of all such appropriation limitations.  Therefore, an official of the issuing entity must offer a certification on  or attached to the project order stating that the funds cited on the project order 
are properly chargeable for the purposes cited in the project order.  5.8 Bona Fide Need  (020508) 
  The issuing entity ’s project order must serve a bona fide need that exists in the fiscal year 
in which the project order is issued; otherwise, a valid obligation is not accomplished.  It is not intended that the bona fide need of the fiscal year rule be construed to preclude procurement lead -
time.  Thus, where materials, for example, cannot be obtained in the same fiscal year in which they 
are needed and contracted for, a provision for delivery in the subsequent fiscal year does not violate the bona fide need rule so long as the time intervening between contracting and delivery is not excessive and the procurement is not for standard commercial items readily available from other sources.  Bona fide need generally is a determination of the requesting entity  and not that of the 
performing entity .  The performing entity , however, must perform  due diligence prior to accepting 
a project order.  It is incumbent upon the performing entity  to review the order for obvious 
deficiencies that would lead the reasonable financial manager to question if the order serve s a bona 
fide need existing in the fi scal year of the appropriation cited on the order.  The performing entity 
must maintain this documentation as part of the project order file.   
 5.9 “Entire /Non -Severable ” Versus “Severable” (020509) 
  5.9.1.  To be eligible for project order financing, the need must be present in the fiscal year in which the project order is issued, require a series of actions over a period of time which may cross a fiscal year, and call for work or services that are reasonably not severable between fiscal years.  For instance, an order for an “entire” end -item or service would call for a single or unified 
outcome or product and would be one in which few, if any benefits would accrue if the work were terminated without completion at the end of the fiscal year in which it was placed.  
  5.9.2.  The distinction between “entire” and “severable” may not be readily evident .  A 
service is non -severable if the service produces a single or unified outcome, product, or report that 
cannot be subdivided for separate performance in different fiscal years.  Whether the subdivision is feasible or not is a matter of judgment.  T he objective desired by the requesting customer must 
be used in the determination.  For example, if the customer supplies an item (for example, an aircraft) for overhaul or renovation and wants the entire item returned in a serviceable state, then a repair of a single component (for example, avionics, landing gear, electronics) of the item when the item consists of many components needing repair, would not  be a “severable” action.  
Conversely, if a customer desires an automated system that consists of multiple modules and some (or all) modules can be used independent of the entire system, then each module that can be used independent of the entire system is severable.  
 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-10  5.9.3.  The following are examples of efforts that are not eligible for  procurement as a  
project order: 
   5.9.3.1.  Custodial or housekeeping services;    5.9.3.2.  Security or fire protection services;    5.9.3.3.  Refuse collection;    5.9.3.4.  Routine maintenance in general, including: grounds or surfaced- area 
maintenance, heating and air conditioning systems operation and maintenance, and other real and personal property maintenance;    5.9.3.5.  Services  such as: subsistence, storage, printing, laundry, welfare, 
transportation (including port handling), travel, utilities or communications when any of these purposes is the primary purpose of the request; and    5.9.3.6.  Efforts where the stated or primary purpose of th e order is to acquire a 
level of effort (e.g., 80 hours of Continuing Education & Training courses, 40 credits of Continuing 
Professional Education, 100 hours, 20 weeks, or one year) rather than a specific, definite, and certain end -product. 
  5.9.4.  The following are examples of efforts in which an entire need generally exists and, 
therefore, are eligible for project order financing:    5.9.4.1.  Manufacture, production, or assembly of items including experimental prototypes or items manufactured and assembled for test.  “Items” include ships, aircraft, guided missiles, other weapons, vehicles of all kinds, ammunition, clothing, machinery and equipment for use in such operations, and other military and operating supplies and equipment (including components and spare parts);     5.9.4.2.  Renovation, rebuild, rehabilitation, reconditioning or overhaul of items, including such operations as are necessary to restore an item to a condition of serviceability equivalent to its original state;    5.9.4.3.  Alterat ion or modification in design or assembly of an item to meet revised 
specifications or to correct defects;  
   5.9.4.4.  Construction or conversion of items (including buildings and other 
structures), utility and communication systems, and other public works;    5.9.4.5.  Development of software programs and automated systems when the purpose of the order is to acquire a specific, definite, and certain non- severable end -product that 
is achievable reasonably with the resources (financial, human, and plant) available to the provider rather than a level of eff ort over an extended period; 
 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-11   5.9.4.6.  Production of engineering and construction related products and services ; 
and 
 
  5.9.4.7.  Education and training contracts for single training courses which are considered a single undertaking.  Multi -year research study work order to produce a publishable 
report.  
 5.10 Commencement of Work  (020510) 
  The work to be performed under project orders must be expected to begin within a 
reasonable time after its acceptance by the performing DoD -owned establishment or the USCG. 
  5.10.1.  Although work on a project order is not required to commence  in the year of project 
order acceptance, as a minimum requirement, evidence must exist at the time of project order acceptance showing the intention that work (or procurement if required prior to the beginning of work) must (1) begin without delay (usually within 90 days) and (2) be completed within the normal production period for the specific work ordered.  
  5.10.2.  If work (or procurement if required prior to the beginning of work) financed from an appropriation that expired for obligation on September 30 on a project order does not begin, or is not expected to begin, before January 1 of the following calendar year, then the project order must be returned by the performing activity for cancellation.  If it is documented that the delay is unavoidable and  could not have been foreseen at the time of project order acceptance, and that 
documentation is retained for audit review, then the project order can be retained and executed.  
 5.11 Contingent Event Prohibition (020511)   A project order must not be issued if commencement of work is contingent upon the 
occurrence of a future event or authorizing action by the ordering entity . 
 5.12 Lawful Purpose (020512)   Project orders must not be used to contravene provisions of the law or accomplish by means 
of this device what regulations do not permit under commercial contracts.  5.13 Authorized Purpose (020513)   Project orders must not be issued for the primary (or secondary) purpose of continuing the 
availability of appropriations.    5.14 Project Order Modifications (020514) 
  5.14.1.  The project order statute differs from the Economy Act at 31 U.S.C. § 1535  
because it permits agencies to account for obligations for orders in the same manner as orders for similar work placed with commercial manufacturers and private contractors.  Project orders, similar to commercial contracts, may contain special provisions a nd may be modified.  Unlike 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-12 procurement contracts with commercial concerns where competition requirements limit 
permissible contract modifications, project orders may be changed or increased at any time to accommodate new or additional work so long as proper funding is available, and so long as the new work otherwise meets the general conditions governing issuance and acceptance of project orders.  
  5.14.2.  If the appropriation used to fund the initial order remains available for new obligation, then use it to fund all modifications that are a bona fide need of that appropriation, even if the modification changes the scope of the project order.     5.14.3.  If the appropriation used to fund the initial order has expired, then use it to fund only those amendments and modifications that are within the general scope of the initial project order.     5.14.4.  All modifications that increase or change the general scope of work of the original order must be charged to a current appropriation.  In cases where the original appropriation has expired and no longer  available for new obligations, and the modification or amendment changes 
the general scope of the original order, the amendment or modification must be funded from a current appropriation.     5.14.5.  The ap propriation cited on the project order must remain available for price 
increases and changes that are within the scope of the original order.  These obligational rules apply equally to fixed price and cost reimbursable project orders.    
 5.14.6.  Limitation of cost clauses in commercial cost -reimbursement contracts that are the 
obligational basis for the requirement to charge current appropriations for all ceiling increases, including those within the general scope of such contracts, are not applicable to cost -
reimbursement project orders.  Limitation of cost clauses govern the legal liability of the United States to third parties, whereas transactions within or between agencies are governed by princip les 
of comity.  Whether to structure  such project orders  on a fixed price or reimbursable basis is a 
matter of agency discretion and convenience, but not obligational relevance.  Whether the work changes the general scope of the original order, or otherwise satisfies an emergent bona fide need of the current fi scal period, governs whether current funds must be charged.  Subject to the 
provisions of paragraph 020708, amendments to project orders which have the effect of partial or 
complete termination of such orders must provide for the inclusion of the costs of termination.  
  5.14.7.  Volume 3, Chapter 10 provides additional guidance on accounting requirements 
for expired and closed accounts.  5.15 Ability to Perform (020515) 
  Project orders must be issued only to those DoD -owned establishments that are capable of 
performing substantially the work ordered.  “Substantially” as used in this paragraph, means that the project order recipient must incur costs of not less than 51 percent of the total costs attributable to rendering the work or services ordered.  Total costs to render the work or services ordered include the costs of goods or services obtained from or provided by contractors. 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-13 5.16 Subsidiary Ordering (020516) 
  The provisions of this chapter are not intended in any way to authorize one DoD -owned 
establis hment to act as a general contracting or purchasing agent for another entity. 
  5.16.1.  Subsidiary ordering (within the government) and contracting (with commercial firms) pursuant to a project order is authorized, given such subsidiary ordering and contr acting is 
incident to, and is for use in, carrying out the purpose of the project order.     5.16.2.  Project orders must contemplate the use of personnel and facilities (and may include the use of other resources) on the part of the project order recipient, but beyond those incident to contract procurement.  In this connection, it is not improper for a project order recipient to subcontract for component parts when the recipient later assembles those parts into the end-product ordered.  The assembly operation includes the use of personnel whose technical skills are essential to completion of the job.  In addition, the work expended in the assembly operation must be of such an extent that it avoids a perception of the project order being used for contract procurement.  
  5.16.3.  If a project order cannot be placed with another DoD -owned establishment because 
that establishment would fill the order by contracting with a commercial concern for performance of substantially the entire order, then it is possible the order could be placed pursuant to the Economy Act.  This Act permits the agency or agency unit filling the order to provide or procure by contract the goods and services necessary to perform the order.  5.17 Project Order Default  (020517) 
  5.17.1.  Where a recipient  of a project order default s or fail s to perform work or services 
specified in the order, and a replacement project order is required as the result of such default, the following apply:    5.17.1.1.  Defaulted work or services may b e procured from another DoD -owned 
establishment or the US CG to the extent of any unobligated balance in the appropriation thus 
obligated.     5.17.1.2.  Similarly, a project order also may be issued to a DoD -owned 
establishment or the US CG under an appropriation obligated by contracts with outside contractors 
when such contract is terminated for default or failure on part of the contractor to perform work or services specified in the contract.   
   5.17.1.3.  Replacement project orders resulting from defaults may be issued and obligated subsequent to the period of availability of the appropriation for obligation if the replacement project order is made without undue delay after the termination of the original contract or project order.    
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-14  5.17.2.  A replacement project order fulfills a bona fide need of the appropriation that had 
funded the contract or project order that was terminated for default.  The replacement project order 
must be awarded on the same basis and be similar substantially to the original project order in its scope and size.  The replacement project order must not extend beyond the point in time in which the ordering appropriation cancels (generally five years after the appropriation expires for new obligation).  5.18 Project Order Financing  (020518) 
  A project order must be financed fully by the ordering DoD Component from obligational authority current at the time the project order is issued and accepted.  P roject order s may be issued 
for a research, development, test and evaluation project which is not financed to completion 
(i.e., prepared on an incrementally programmed basis ).  A research, development, test and 
evaluation appropriation project or program financed on an incrementally programmed basis is one that is funded for the remainder of the funding appropriation’s period of current availability or the current fiscal year vice a fully -funded- to-completion basis.  
 5.19 Direct -Cite Prohibition  (020519) 
  A DoD- owned establishment  may only accept project orders on a reimbursable ba sis.  
Orders must not be made a subdivision of funds, similar to an allotment; nor the appropriations of the ordering entity be cited by the performing DoD -owned establishment when incurring and 
recording obligations incurred in performance of the order.  5.20 Reimbursement of Costs Incurred in Performance of a Project Order  (020520) 
  Reimbursement of costs incurred by a performing activity may be accomplished in the 
manner ordinarily used by that performing activity.  Volume 5, Chapter 9 “Disbursement”  
recognizes that a disbursement may result from a transfer of funds from one appropriation or fund 
to another by a “no check drawn” transaction using a Standard Form (SF) 1080, Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds; SF 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits; or by the Department of the Treasury's Intra -governmental Payment and Collection 
(IPAC) system.  Volume 5, Chapter 11 provides additional information on the IPAC system and 
also identifies general requirements and technic al specifications prescribed by the Treasury on the 
use of IPAC.  6.0 CONDITIONS GOVERNING PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT ORDERS  (0206) 
 6.1 Timeliness  (020601) 
 
 After acceptance, project orders must be performed as expeditiously as possible according 
to the terms as accepted.  (See paragraph 020510 for additional information.) 
  
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-15 6.2 Notification of Delivery Schedule (020602) 
  Performing DoD -owned establishments a re responsible for promptly advising ordering 
DoD Components of all goods delivered and/or service rendered, and of any changes in delivery schedules.  
 *6.3 Summary of Costs (020603)   For cost -reimbursement project orders, performing DoD -owned establishments must give 
ordering DoD Components a summary of costs incurred to date and estimates of costs to complete the order no less than quarterly, but no more frequently than once a month.  No special report 
forms are authorized for this purpose.  6.4 Expiration Dates (020604)   Expiration dates of project orders may be extended with the approval of the ordering DoD Component.  Expiration dates of project orders may not extend beyond the poi nt in time in which 
the ordering appropriation cancels.  7.0 REIMBURSEMENTS TO PERFORMING DOD- OWNED ESTABLISHMENTS  (0207) 
 7.1 Reimbursement  (020701) 
  Performing DoD -owned establishments must be reimbursed for work covered by project 
orders based upon fix ed prices or costs incurred . 
 7.2 Fixed Price Project Orders  (020702) 
  7.2.1.  A fixed price project order must establish a firm price for purposes of reimbursement for the work or services ordered.  A fixed price basis may be used when  all of the 
following conditions are present.    7.2.1.1.  Work specifications are stable, specific, and definite; and they are made part of the order (or incorporated by reference) for each item when the project order is accept ed 
for performance on a fixed price basis or amended for any changes in the scope of the work.  This requirement is critical especially for project order -accepting activities financed by a direct 
appropriation.  An activity financed by a direct appropriation must not accept a fixed price project order unless the activity can predict with a high degree of certainty the actual cost to complete the project order.  Otherwise, the activity may violate the prohibition against inappropriately augmenting an appropriation and/or using an appropriation for a purpose not authorized.  
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-16   7.2.1.2.  When there is more than one item of work or service in a project order, 
including amendments for changes in scope, each item is made the subject of a separate price as shown by the order or in a list incorporated therein by reference.  When the work to be performed is the subject of a work list (e.g., equipment overhaul) each entry on the work list must be considered to be an item.    7.2.1.3.  No substantial contingencies are included in the price, nor considered to be involved in performance, so that cost variations in performance reasonably can be expected to be minor.    7.2.1.4.  There is a satisfactory system of cost estimating used as a basis for establishing fixed prices.  When cost standards are used in cost estimating for the purpose of 
pricing, they must be adjusted for this purpose to include expected cost variances.      7.2.1.5.  The same cost elements are used in cost estimating and establishing fixed prices  as would be required for use if reimbursements were based upon actual cost incurred.   
  7.2.2.  The requirement to establish a firm price for purposes of reimbursement for the work or services ordered does not preclude the issuance of amendments/modifications to cover changes in scope of any item in the order.    7.3 Cost- Reimbursement Project Orders  (020703) 
  7.3.1.  The amount stated in a cost -reimbursement project order must be a sound estimate 
of the costs to be incurred in performance of the work or  services ordered.  Such estimates must 
be determined based upon the specific work to be performed.  The estimate of costs must be the 
ceiling amount for purposes of reimbursement for the work or services ordered.     7.3.2.  The performing DoD -owned estab lishment and the ordering DoD Component must 
undertake timely renegotiations for revisions of the ceiling amount of cost- reimbursement project 
orders.  Such renegotiations must take place whenever cost performance indicates the need for adjustment of the ceiling amount upward or downward, but before the cost of performance has 
exceeded 75 percent, when compared with the current ceiling amount.  Renegotiations need not be conducted when the probable cost of renegotiation is greater than the adjustment amount.  In such cases, the performing establishment must absorb the difference, upward or downward.  
 7.3.3.  Cost- reimbursement project orders may be converted to a fixed price basis provided 
all conditions governing the use of fixed price project orders are p resent  (see paragraph 020702).  
In addition, the conversion must occur  prior to incurring either 50 percent of the total cost of the 
work, or 50 percent of the period of performance, whichever comes first. 
 7.4 Unfunded Costs (020704)   For purposes of this paragraph, “unfunded costs” are costs that are not funded in the 
account or appropriation that funds the performing activity.  (Examples of unfunded costs are not universal.  Some performing revolving fund accounts, primarily the working capital fund accounts, 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-17 may fund costs that are unfunded by appropriated funds.  Unfunded costs of a  performing activity 
funded by an appropriation normally include labor of military personnel and depreciation of capital 
assets.)  When an ordering DoD Component places an order on behalf of persons or agencies 
outside the U.S. Government (including reimbursable transactions pursuant to Foreign Military Sales  discussed in Volume 15), the ordering DoD Component must identify this circumstance on 
the project order.  Under this circumstance, the amount of unfunded costs must be specifically identified and included in the amounts contained in the:   7.4.1.  Project orders issued to performing activities;   7.4.2.  Billings made by the performing activity to the ordering activity;   7.4.3.  Reimbursements by the ordering activity to the performing activity; and   7.4.4.  Reimbursements obtained by the ordering activity from the non- federal customer.  
 7.5 Working Capital Fund (020705)   In the case of a performing DoD- owned establishment operating under a working capital 
fund, reimbursable costs must be determined in accordance with Volume 11B.  7.6 Non-Working Capital Fund (020706) 
  When the performing DoD -owned establishment is not operating under a working capital 
fund, a reimbursable agreement negotiated prior to the placement of a project order must be 
executed in accordance with the policy requirements contained in Chapter 1.    7.7 Reimbursable Costs (020707)   Reimbursable costs include the cost of machinery or equipment acquired specifically for 
the performance of a single project order.  Such costs must be specifically approved in the following circumstances:     7.7.1.  In ad vance by the ordering DoD Component, 
  7.7.2.  When the machinery or equipment legally could be acquired directly by the ordering fund or appropriation, or   7.7.3.  Approval is incorporated into the term s of the project order agreement or 
amendments thereto.  When this is the case, the approved costs must be segregated from other costs and shown as a separate item in the reimbursable billing.  Such machinery and equipment are the property of the ordering DoD Component and must be disposed of in accordance with instructions from the ordering DoD Component.   
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-18 7.8 Termination Costs  (020708) 
 
 Costs incurred in the termination of a project order must be reimbursable to the performing 
DoD- owned establishment when the order is  terminated by the ordering DoD Component, to the 
extent that such costs do not exceed the amount of the fixed price or the current ceiling amount specified in the case of cost -reimbursement project orders.  When ordering DoD Components and 
performing DoD -owned establishments cannot agree on the costs of termination, the case must be 
referred through Component financial management channels for settlement by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  7.9 Billing  (020709) 
  To the extent feasible, perform ing DoD -owned establishments must bill ordering DoD 
Components for work performed upon the basis of jobs completed or services rendered in accordance with the terms of the project order.  Whenever a long period of time is required in the performance of a p roject order, periodic progress payments approximating costs incurred may be 
provided for in the order.  Progress payments may be made to the performing DoD -owned 
establishment to cover the accrued cost (and other direct obligations incurred) of performanc e to 
the end of the fiscal year under an uncompleted project order.  Reimbursement to a working capital fund activity for work performed prior to completion of the project order must be accomplished normally on either a progress payment or a percentage-of-completion basis.  8.0 ACCOUNTING FOR COST OF PERFORMANCE  (0208) 
 8.1 Administration  (020801) 
  Project orders are reimbursable orders and must be administered and accounted for as such.  
Therefore, p roject orders  may not  be administered or accounted for by performing DoD -owned 
establishments as separate subdivisions of appropriations or funds similar to an allotment.  The appropriation type accounting for project orders must be performed by the ordering DoD 
Component in a manner similar to that performed f or commercial contracts.   
 8.2 Working Capital Fund (020802)   The operations of performing DoD -owned establishments financed under a working capital 
fund must be accounted for in accordance with Volume 11B.    8.3 Obligation Authority (020803)   Project orders received and accepted are the source of reimbursable obligational authority, 
in the amount of the accepted project order, for the performance of services or delivery of goods 
requested.  
   
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 2  
* May 2021 
2-19 8.4 Costs Accounts (020804) 
  Cost account s must be maintained  to accumulate the costs of performance for all project 
orders.  Those cost accounts serve as a basis for determining the amount reimbursable for cost -
reimbursement project orders and as a basis of determining a fixed price for similar future  fixed 
price project orders.  8.5 Billings  (020805) 
  Billings covering reimbursements must identify costs for each project line /subline item in 
accordance with the accepted project order (FS Form 7600A).  The billing standard is discussed in Chapter 1.  9.0 EXEMPTIONS  (0209) 
  Requests for exemptions, along with appropriate justification, must be submitted to the 
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) , Deputy Chief Financial Officer .

ECONOMY ACT ORDERS  
 
1.0 GENERAL  (0301) 
 1.1 Purpose (030101)   This chapter prescribes  the financial management policy applicable to orders placed for 
goods and services within the authority provided for in Title 31, United States Code , section 1535  
(31 U.S.C. § 1535
) (the Econ omy Act of 1932, as amended) .  Chapter 1 provides overall guidance 
on general reimbursement procedures and supporting documentation. 
 *1.2 Authoritative Guidance (030102)  
  1.2.1.  10 U.S.C. § 2410a
 provides statutory authority for severable service contracts for 
periods crossing fiscal years. 
  1.2.2.  10 U.S.C. § 2205
 provides statutory authority for reimbursements made to 
appropriations of the Department of Defense (DoD) under 31 U.S.C. §§ 1535 and 1536. 
  1.2.3.  31 U.S.C. § 1502
 stipulates the bona fide need s rule . 
  1.2.4.  31 U.S.C. § 1535
 provides the authority for F ederal agencies to order goods and 
services from major organizations within the same agency or other Federal agencies . 
  1.2.5.  31 U.S.C. § 1536
 provides the authority for crediting  payments  received on orders 
executed under 31 U.S.C. § 1535.  Payments  may be credited  to the appropriation or fund against 
which charges were made to fill the order, or to replace stocks on hand used to fill the order , unless 
another law authorizes the amount to be credited to some other appropriation or fund; or t he head 
of the performing agency decides that replacement is not necessary, in which case, the amount received is deposited in the United States (U.S.) Department of the Treasury  (Treasury)  as 
miscellaneous receipts.  
  1.2.6.  DoD Instruction 4000.19

2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 3  
* September 2019  
3-6  1.2.8.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 17.5 , “Interagency Acquisitions ,” 
provides federal -wide  acquisition policy related to interagency acquisitions.  Unde r this Subpart, 
FAR 17.502-2  provides additional acquisition policy specifically related to Economy Act orders. 
 
 1.2.9.  The Treasury Financial Manual  (TFM) Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 4700,  
Section  4706 , “Intragovernmental Quarterly and Year -End Requirements.” 
 *2.0 DEFINITIONS  (0302) 
 2.1 Assisted Acquisition  (030201)  
  FAR Subpart 2.1
 defines an assisted acquisition as a type of interagency acquisition where 
a servicing agency performs acquisition activities on a requesting agency’s behalf, such as 
awarding and administering a contract, task order, or delivery order.  DFARS 217.701  defines 
assisted acquisition similarly as the type of  interagency contracting through which acquisition 
officials of a non- DoD agency award a contract, task, or delivery order for the acquisition of 
supplies or services on behalf of DoD. 
 2.2 Direct Acquisition  (030202)  
  Per FAR Subpart 2.1, a direct acquisition is a type of interagency acquisition where a 
requesting agency places an order directly against a servicing agency’s indefinite -delivery 
contract.  The servicing agency manages the indefinite- delivery contract but does not participate 
in the placemen t or administration of an order.  DFARS 217.701 defines direct acquisition as a 
type of interagency contracting through which DoD orders a supply or service from a Governmentwide acquisition contract maintained by a non- DoD agency . 
 2.3 Interagency Acquisition  (030203)  
  As defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, an interagency acquisition is an action  by which an agency 
needing supplies or services (the requesting agency) obtains them from another agency (the servicing agency) by an assisted acquisition or a direct acquisition.  The term includes acquisitions 
under the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. § 1535) and Non- Economy Act acquisitions completed under 
other statutory authorities.  2.4 Multiple Year Appropriation  (030204) 
  As used in this chapter, a multiple year appropriation means a n appropriation that is 
available for obligation for a definite period of time in excess of one fiscal year.  2.5 Non-Severable Service (030205) 
  A non- severa ble service represent s a single undertaking that cannot be feasibly subdivided.  
If the service produces  a single or unified outcome, product, or report, the service is  considered 
non-severable.  
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 3  
* September 2019  
3-7 2.6 Requesting Agency (030206) 
  The requesting agency is defined in FAR Subpart 2.1 as the agency that has the requirement 
for an interagency acquisition.  2.7 Servicing Agency (030207)   The servicing agency is defined in FAR Subpart 2.1 as the agency that will conduct an 
assisted acquisition on behalf of the requesting agency.  2.8 Severable Service (030208) 
  A severable service represents a s ervice that is  continuing and recurring in nature where 
the agency realizes a benefit at the time that the service is provided even if the contract has not 
been performed to completion.  A service is considered severable if it can be separated into a 
component that independently provide s value to meet an agency’s need.  
 3.0 LEGAL AUTHORITY (0303) 
 3.1 Statutory Conditions on Use  (030301)  
  31 U.S.C. § 1535 establishes four basic conditions on the use of Economy Act authorities.  In accordance with the statute, the head of an agency or major organizational unit within an agency 
may place an order with a major organizational unit within the same agency or another agency for goods or services if:   3.1.1.  Funds are available;  
  3.1.2.  The head of the requesting agency or unit decides the order is in the best interest of 
the U.S. Government;   3.1.3.  The  agency or unit to be asked to fill the order is able to provide or obtain by contract 
the ordered goods or services; and   3.1.4.  The head of the requesting agency decides that ordered goods or services cannot be 
provided by contract as conveniently or e conomically by a commercial enterprise.  
 3.2 Reimbursements to Appropriations (030302)  
  As stated in 10 U.S.C. § 2205, r eimbursements made to DoD appropriations under 
31 U.S.C. §§ 1535 and 1536 for services rendered or supplies furnished may be credited to the 
appropriation or fund of the activity performing the reimbursable work.  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 3  
* September 2019  
3-8 3.3 Limitations  (030303) 
 
 Economy Act orders may not be used by an agency to: 
 3.3.1.  Circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of funds, including 
extending the period of availability of the cited funds; 
  3.3.2.  Contravene provisions of the law or accomplish what regulations do not permit under commercial contracts;  
  3.3.3.  Make acquisitions  conflicting with any other agency’s authority or responsibility 
(see FAR 17.501
) or for which the servicing agency is required by law to provide and for which it 
received appropriations ; or 
  3.3.4.  O rder work or services from another organizational unit under the same activity 
commander where the activity commander is in a position to fund the required goods or services through the use of direct funds.  4.0 USES OF ECONOMY ACT ORDERS  (0304) 
  Economy Act orders may be used for any required goods, supplies or services that are 
appropriate and legal.  Acquisition policies contained in the FAR, DFARS, and within individual 
DoD Component’ s implementation guidance govern the potential uses of Economy Act orders.  
Typical uses include, but are not limited to, base support (host -tenant) services such as 
administrative services, civilian personnel services, community services, environmental compliance, fire protection, food service, health service, mail  service, police service, 
security/guard services, and warehousing.  5.0 INITIATING AN ECONOMY ACT ORDER  (030 5) 
 *5.1 Determinations and Findings Requirement (030501)   FAR
 17.502- 2(c) requires each Economy Act order to be supported by a determinations 
and findings (D&F) that must be furnished to the servicing agency with the order.  Specific D&F requirements are stated  in FAR 17.502-2(c) and 
DFARS 217.503 . 
 *5.2 Ordering Procedures and Requirements  (030502) 
  FAR 17.503
, DFARS Subpart 217.5, and DFARS Subpart 217.7 address the procedures 
that apply to all interagency acquisitions, including those made under the authority provided within the Economy Act.

* September 2019  
3-9 *5.3 Treasury Guidance  (030503) 
 
 5.3.1.  The TFM Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 4700, Section 4706, 
“Intragovernmental Quarterly  and Year -End Requirements, ” discusses the requirements necessary 
to properly report intragovernmental transactions resulting from business activities (i.e., buy/ sell 
transactions) between two Federal government entities, called trading partners.  It further references the Intragovernmental Transaction Guide ( Appendix 6) as containing the business rules 
and processes to properly record, report, and reconcile intragovernmental transactions, including the processes for dispute resolution.   5.3.2.  The  guidance in TFM, Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 4700, Appendix 6, Section  9 
provides the standard Interagency Agreement (IAA)  
 containing two Fiscal Service (FS)  Forms : 
FS Form 7600A , General Terms and Conditions (GT&C) and FS  Form  7600B , Order Form.   
Treasury has mandated the use of these  two forms to ensure the proper recording and reporting on 
intragovernmental buy/sell transactions, and to eliminate the federal -wide reporting deficiencies 
impacting the Financial Report of the U.S.  Government.  Accordingly, all DoD Components must 
use the  latest published versions of  FS Form s 7600A/B when completing an Economy Act Order 
and these mus t comply with the Federal Intrag overnmental Data Standards when using the 
Treasury's G -Invoicing  system , DoD Ordering systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, or when 
completing the FS  Forms 7600 A/B manually . 
  5.3.3.  The Treasury's G -Invoicing system must  be used to negotiate, broker, and 
electronically store the GT&Cs  and associated transactions  between buyers and sellers for all 
inter- and i ntragovernmental reimbursable transactions as appropriate system capabilities come 
online for individual DoD Components.  This requirement is for all IAAs with a performance 
period extending to June 30, 2021 or later.  In instances where G -Invoicing is not available, such 
as remote deployments or other austere conditions, DoD Components must use hardcopies of FS Forms  7600A/B .  DoD Components must establish internal policies and procedures for 
designating signature authority for GT&Cs.   5.3.4.  The requesting scope of work on the FS Form 7600A should cover relatively broad categories of goods or services when feasible.   However, the FS Form 7600B must discretely describe the g oods or services ordered with the associated FS Form 7600A.  When practical  and 
legally permissible , the agreement period on the FS Form 7600A should cover multiple years. 
 6.0 POLICY  (0306) 
 6.1 Specific, Definite , and Certain  (030601) 
  Economy Act orders must  be specific, definite, and certain both as to the work 
encompassed by the order and the terms of the order itself.

* September 2019  
3-10 6.2 Certification of Availability for Purpose (030602) 
  Economy Act orders are subject to the same fiscal limitations that are contained within the 
appropriation from which they are funded.  However, the performing entity may not be aware of all such appropriation limitations.  Therefore, the requesting official must provide a certification, 
on or attached to the Economy Act order, stating  that the funds cited on the Economy Act order 
are properly chargeable for the purposes cited in the order.  6.3 Bona Fide Need  (030603) 
  Economy Act orders citing an annual or multi ple year appropriation must serve a bona fide 
need arising, or existing, in the fiscal year(s) for which the appropriation is available for obligation (refer to 31 U.S.C. § 1502) .  Otherwise, a valid obligation is not accomplished.  Bona fide need 
generally is a determination of the requesting activity and not that of the servicing activity.  A servicing activity should, however, refuse to accept an Economy Act order if it is obvious that the order does not serve a need existing in the fiscal year for which the appropriation is available.  6.4 Appropri ation Policy  (030604) 
 
 6.4.1.  Obligation .  An Economy Act order obligates the applicable appropriation of the 
requesting agency or unit upon acceptance of the order by the servicing agency.  Th us, the 
requesting agency should obligate the entire amount of a reimbursable order when the order is 
accepted  by the servicing agency. 
   6.4.1.1.  Annual appropriations are not available for requirements that are bona fide needs of a subsequent fiscal year, except pursuant to statutory authority.  DoD Components that 
enter into Economy Act agreements with other organizations to satisfy requirements for severable services, non- severable services, and supplies must ensure that obligations for the Economy Act 
agreements constitute a bona fide need of the annual appropriation charged.  Consequently, any supply or service contract entered into by the servicing  agency must be entered into before the end 
of the period of availability of the annual appropriation.    6.4.1.2.  To constitute a bona fide need of the requesting activity’s annual 
appropriation, any resultant contract for supplies or services entered into by the servicing  agency 
must satisfy the same obligational requirements set forth in Volume 3, Chapter 8, as would any 
contract directly entered into by the requ esting activity.  For example, an Economy Act agreement 
for severable services may be performed by issuance of a contract that crosses fiscal years only if the awarded contract satisfies the requirements of 10 U.S.C. § 2410a, the contract period does not exceed 1 year , and the contract period commences during the period of availability for the 
requesting agency’s  appropriation(s). 
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 3  
* September 2019  
3-11   6.4.1.3.  Multiple year appropriations may be obligated for requirements that 
constitute bona fide needs of the multiple  year period of a vailability of the appropriation.  Multiple 
year appropriations obligated for Economy Act orders are subject to the same bona fide need standards as would a contract directly entered into by the request ing activity.  Resultant supply 
and service contracts must be entered into during the period of availability of the appropriation funding the Economy Act order, and are subject to the same budgetary full funding or incremental funding policies prescribed in Volumes 2A and 2B.    6.4.1.4.  Resultant contracts for non- severable services that cross fiscal years must 
be supported entirely by the requesting agency’s  appropriations available for new obligations at 
the time the contract is awarded.  
 *  6.4.1.5.  Because Research , Development, T est and Evaluation (RDT&E) 
requirements are iterative in nature, RDT&E programs, projects and activities are not subject to full funding policies.  For example, DFARS 232.703-1
 permits DoD organizations to 
incrementally fund a fixed -price contract for severable services  if the contract is funded with 
research and development appropriations.  Refer to DFARS 232.703- 1 for additional guidance and 
restrictions .  Similarly, DoD budgetary policy in Volume 2A , Chapter 1 provides that RDT&E 
budget estimates are prepared on an incrementally funded basis and only those funds required for work in a given fiscal year must  be included in the RDT&E request for that fiscal year.  
DoD Components are encouraged to fully fund RDT&E contracts for non- severable services.  
   6.4.1.6.  Obligating funds for an Economy Act order where the resultant 
fixed -length severable services contract will exceed the 1 -year limit set forth in  10 U.S.C. § 2410a  
or will not commence until a subsequent fiscal year, may result in an Anti deficiency Act violation 
under 31 U.S.C. § 1341
. 
 
 6.4.2.  Deobligation .  Transactions undertaken in reliance on authority conferred by the 
Economy Act are subject to statutory requirements imposed by 31 U.S.C.  § 1535(d) governing 
when excess funds must be deobligated.  The amount obligated by the requesting agency or unit 
must be deobligated to the extent that the servicing agency has not incurred obligations before the end of the period of availability of the ordering appropriation.  It is critical that activities rec oncile 
the obligation status of Economy Act orders and deobligate unused funds, as needed, before the end of the funds availability.  Funds must be deobligated by both the requesting and servicing agency to the extent that the servicing agency or unit filling the order has not (1) provided the goods or services, or (2)  entered into an authorized contract with another entity to provide the 
requested goods or services  before the end of the period of availability (fiscal year or multiple year 
period, as applicable) of the appropriation of the requesting or ordering agency. 
 6.5 Commencement of Work  (030605) 
  The work to be performed under Economy Act orders must  be expected to begin within a 
reasonable time after its acceptance by the servicing  agency .

* September 2019  
3-12 6.6 Contingent Event Prohibition (030606) 
  Economy Act orders must  not be issued if commencement of work is contingent upon the 
occurrence of a future event or authorizing action by the requesting agency . 
 7.0 PAYMENT PROCEDURES  (0307) 
 7.1 Payment s (030701) 
  7.1.1.  Payment must  be made promptly upon the written request (or  billing) of the agency 
or unit filling the order.  Unless the DoD Component is specifically authorized by law, legislative action or Presidential authorization, funds are not to be advanced to non -DoD Federal entities or 
be used to pay for advance billings without the receipt of goods or services.  Refer to Volume 4, Chapter 5 for the conditions and requirements related to advances and prepayments.   7.1.2.  For those few exceptions where DoD is specifically authorized by a specific 
appropriation or law to advance funds, the specific appropriation or law authorizing the advance must be cited on the obligating and/or interagency agreement documents and orders.  Advance payments, when authorized, are based on estimated costs , but the final payment amount must be 
adjusted to account for actual costs.  Any unused amounts of the advance must  be collected from 
the performing agency immediately and returned to the fund from which originally made.   7.1.3.  The requesting official must be fully aware of the non- DoD Federal agency’s billing 
practices and methods.  If an advance of funds is permitted, the DoD agency requesting official must  ensure that the written agreement with the servicing agency requires it to specifically account 
for the funds advanced.  The requesting official must  also take appropriate action to ensure DoD 
funds are not disbursed in advance of contract performance.  Additionally, DoD Components must work with their servicing disbursement sites to ensure trading partner agre ements restrict other 
Federal agencies’ ability to withdraw funds prior to the delivery of goods or performance of 
services.  
 7.2 Small Amounts  (030702) 
  7.2.1.  DoD working capital funds, the Corps of Engineers Civil Works Revolving Fund, and other DoD revolving funds may not waive reimbursement of any amount.  This does not preclude identification of a central payment office by a DoD Component to pay small bills.  Guidance on financial management of working capital funds is in Volume 11B.   7.2.2.  When an appropriated fund activity is the performer and the amount to be billed within the same DoD Component or to another DoD Component is less than $1,000, the billing may be suspended by the billing organization until the end of the fiscal year, or unt il the total billed 
exceeds $1,000.  However, no later than the end of the fiscal year, all suspended amounts must be billed even though the amount to be billed is less than $1,000.   
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 3  
* September 2019  
3-13  7.2.3.  When the amount to be billed to a non -DoD U.S. Government activity is less than 
$1,000, the billing may be suspended by the billing organization until the end of the fiscal year, or 
until the total billed exceeds $1,000.  However, no later than the end of the fiscal year, all suspended amounts must be billed to non- DoD U.S. Government activities even though the amount 
to be billed is less than $1,000.  8.0 REIMBURSEMENTS  (0308) 
 8.1 Appropriated Funds  (030801) 
  Reimbursement under the Economy Act is to be made on the basis of actual cost as 
determined by the servicing agency.  The requesting agency must pay the servicing agency the 
actual costs of the goods or services provided.  Actual costs include all direct costs attributable to providing the goods or services, regardless of whether the servicing agency's expenditures are increased.  Actual costs also include indirect costs (overhead) to the extent they have a significant relationship to providing the goods or services and benefit the requesting agency.  Indirect costs (overhead) must  be computed in accordance with Chapter 1.  DoD activities not funded by working 
capital funds normally do not charge indirect costs to other DoD activities.  In accordance with  
FAR 17.502-2.d.(4) , the servicing agency may not require a payment of , or the requesting agency 
pay, any fee or charge in excess of the actual cost (or estimated cost if the actual cost is not known)  
of entering into and administering the contract  or other agreement under which the order is filled.  
Chapter 1 provides the general rules that DoD Components mu st follow  when determining 
amounts to be collected as reimbursements.  
 8.2 Working Capital Fund Activities (030802)   Reimbursable costs in the case of servicing DoD activities operating under a working 
capital fund must  be determined in accordance with Volume 11B. 
 9.0 ACCOUNTING (0309)  
 9.1 Direct Fund Cite Order s (030901) 
  Economy Act order s may be issued as direct fund cite order s where the requesting unit 
identifies the appropriate fund citation for the servicing unit to place on the requested contract or reimbursable order.  Economy Act order s must  neither be administered nor accounted for by 
servicing DoD activit ies as separate subdivisions of appropriations or funds similar to an allotment.  
Appropriation- type (e.g., annual, no- year, multiyear) accounting for an Economy Act order must  
be performed by the requesting DoD Component in accordance with Volume 3, Chapter 15.  9.2 Work ing Capital Fund (030 902) 
  The operations of servicing DoD activities financed under a working capital fund must  be 
accounted for in accordance with Volume 11B.   
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 3  
* September 2019  
3-14 9.3 Obligation Authority (030903) 
  Economy Act orders received and accepted are the source of obligational authority in the 
amount of the order for the performance of the work requested.  9.4 Cost Account (030904)   A cost account, or other device, must  be used to accumulate the costs of performance for 
all Economy Act orders.  The cost account serves as a historical basis for determining the amount 
reimbursable for cost -reimbursement Economy Act orders and as a basis of determining a 
fixed -price for similar future fixed -price Economy Act orders.  
 9.5 Records  (030905) 
  The servicing DoD Component must  establish procedures that identify and retain a record 
of the requestor’s appropriation accounting classification(s) for each order received.  Establishment and compliance with these procedures  will facilitate auditability of the requestor’s 
source of funding.  *9.6 Billings  (030906) 
  Billings covering reimbursements must  identify costs by each item listed in the 
Economy Act order.  Volume 10, Chapter 10 contains the DoD policy for executing 
intragovernmental payments.  
 *9.7 Reconciliation and Elimination of Intragovernmental Transactions (030907)  
  Volume 6B , Chapter 13 contains DoD policy and guidance for adjustments, eliminations, 
and other special intragovernmental reconciliation procedures.

USER FEES  
 
1.0 GENERAL   
 *1.1 Overview   The Federal Government must  assess  user fees against each identifiable recipient for special 
benefits derived from Federal activities beyond those received by the general public .  The User 
Charge Statute, Title 31, United States Code, section 9701 ( 31 U .S.C.  §9701) , “Fees and Charges 
for Government S ervic es and Things of V alue,”) establishes that it is the sense of Congress that any 
work, service, publication, report, document, benefit, privilege, authority, use, franchise, license, permit, certificate, registration or similar thing of value or utility performed, furnished, provided, granted, prepared, or issued by an agency (except a mixed -ownership Government corporation) to a 
person (except a person on official business of the United States (U.S.) Government) is to be self -
sustaining to the extent possible.  
 
The D
epartment of Defense (DoD) is authorized by legislation to establish user fees, in 
accordance with the guidelines that are defined by 31 U.S.C. §9701.   
The Office of Management and Budget ( OMB) Circular A -25 Revised ,  “User charges,” 
and Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 require federal agencies to review, on a biennial basis, the 
fees, royalties, rents, and  other charges imposed by the agency for services and things of value  
provided to specific recipients, beyond those received by the general public.  The purpose of  this 
review is to periodically adjust existing charges to reflect  unanticipated changes in costs or market 
values, and to review all other agency programs to determine whether fees should be assessed for 
Government services or the use of Government goods or services.    
 
*1.2 P
urpose 
  This chapter :  
  1.2.1.   Promulgates  Department of Defense (DoD) policy regarding establishment and 
assessment of appropriate fees for services or thing s of value supplied by DoD Components . 
  1.2.2.   Provides information on the scope and types of activities subject to user charges and 
the basis upon which user charges are to be calculated .   
  1.2.3.   Provides guidance on Component implementation of user  charges and the disposition 
of collections.    
  1.2.4.  Does not apply to user fees associated with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
or the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended, 5 U.S.C. §552a.  Refer to Regulation DoD 5400.7 , “DoD 
Freedom of Information Act Progr am” and DoD 5400.11 , “DoD Privacy  and  Civil Liberties  
Program .”

* October 2023 
4-4 1.3 Authoritative Guidance 
  The accounting policy and related requirements prescribed by this chapter are in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of:  
  1.3.1.   31 U.S.C. § 9701, “ Fees and C harges for Government Services and T hings of 
Value.”  This statute authorizes the head of each agency to prescribe regulations establishing the 
charge for a service or thing of value provided by an agency.  
  1.3.2.   Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 , require s federal agencies to review, on a 
biennial basis, the fees, royalties, rents, and other charges imposed by the agency for services and things of value provided to specific recipients, beyond those received by the general publi c. 
  *1.3.3.   31 U.S.C. § 3302 , “Custodians of money.”  Th
 e User Charge Statute is a 
codification of a provision in Title V of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952, which provided broad authority to assess user fees or charges on identifiable beneficiaries by administrative regulation.   This statute details the Federal Government’s custodial responsibilities 
of public money.  Subsection (b) is the basis for the requirement that unless authorized by law, an agency may not retain and use money received from sources other than congressional appropriations; the money must instead be deposited in the Treasury.     1.3.4.  10 U.S
.C. § 2667, “Leases: non -ex cess property of military departments and 
Defense Agencies.”  This statute provides authority to the  Secretary of Defense to lease non -excess 
real or personal property and accept either cash or an in -kind consideration as payment. 
 
 1.3.5.  OMB
 Circular A -25 Revised , “User C harges .”  This Circular establishes Federal 
policy regarding fees assessed for Government services and sale or use of Government goods or 
resources.   In any case where an OMB circular provides guidance concerning a specific user charge 
area, the guidance of that circular must  be deemed to meet the requirements of this Circular.   
Examples of such guidance include the following: OMB Circular A -45, concerning charges for 
rental quarters; OMB Circular A- 130,  concerning management of Federal information resources; 
and OMB Circular  A-97 , concerning provision of specialized technical services to State and Local 
governments.  2.0 RESPON
SIBILITIES

 3.0 USER FEES   
 3.1 General  Policy  
  *3.1.1  Collections are credited to the General Fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (hereafter referred to as Treasury) as miscellaneous receipts as required by 31 U.S.C. § 3302, or if specific statutory authority is available, may be retained by the Component for a specific purpose (e.g., Agriculture and Grazing ( 10 U.S.C. § 2667), Forestry (10 U.S.C. § 2665), 
Recycling  (10 U.S.C. § 2577),   Roy alties ( 10 U.S.C. § 3710c ), and Licensing of Intellectual 
Property  ( 10 U.S.C. § 2260) revenue programs).   
  3.1.2.  User fees should only be established and implemented if : 
   3.1.2.1.  M andated  by specific statutory authority, or when implemented under the 
authority of the User Charge Statute ; and 
   3.1.2.2.  T he monetary benefits to the Federal G overnment of receipts collected 
significantly exceed  the costs of collecting the fees.    
  3.1.3.  Since generating and maintaining reliable cost data is expensive, consideration must be given to the cost of personnel and related data gathering requirement s, and the costs of 
implementing, maintaining, and using financial management systems when determining the level of cost detail required and whether or not monetary benefits exceed costs.   3.1.4.  It is DoD policy not to compete unfairly with available commercial facilities in providing special services or in the sale or lease of property to private parties and agencies outside the Federal Government.  However, when a service (or privilege) provides  special benefits to an 
identifiable recipient, beyond those that accrue to the general public, a fee should generally be 
imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal G overnment for providing the special benefit (or the 
market price) except as otherwise  approved by the USD(C) and authorized by the Director of the 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 4  
* October 2023 
4-7 OMB.  A special benefit will be considered to accrue, and a user fee sh ould be imposed, when a 
government service:  
 
  3.1.4.1.  Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial ga ins or 
values (which may or may not be measurable in monetary terms) than those which accrue to the general public (e.g.   receiving a patent, insurance, or guarantee provision, or a license to carry on a 
specific activity or business of various kinds of public land use), or  
   3.1.4.2.  Provides business stability or contributes to public confidence in the 
business activity of the beneficiary (e.g., insuring deposits in commercial banks), or    3.1.4.3.  Is performed at the request of or for the convenience of the recipient and is 
beyond the services regularly received by other members of the same industry or group or by the general public (e.g., receiving a passport, visa, airman's certificate, or a Custom's inspection after regular duty hours).  
 3.2 Applicability  
  None of the provisions in this chapter should be construed as giving authority for the sale or 
lease of property, or the rendering of special services.  Actions to convey such special benefits must be authorized by separate authority.  This user fee policy is applicable except when other statutes or directives specifically direct other practices or procedures, such as for:  
  3.2.1.   Services to military personnel and civilian employees of the Do D provided in 
accordance with section 5.0. 
  3.2.2.  Products and services provided to military personnel, their families, and civilian DoD 
employees by DoD Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (i.e., morale, welfare, and recreation (military and civilia n), Military Services exchanges, lodging, supplemental mission funds, and 
special purpose central funds).  Fees for such services are governed by DoD Instruction  
(DoDI)  1015.15, “Establishment, Management, and Control of Nonappropriated Fund 
Instrumentalities and Financial Management of Supporting Reso urces,” and other Office of the 
Secretary of Defense policy.  
  3.2.3.   S 
ale or disposal of surplus property under specifically approved programs  (please 
refer to Chapter  5). 
  3.2.4.   Services furnished the general public relating to, or in furtherance of, the Armed 
Forces recruiting program.  
  3.2.5.   Services furnished to representatives of the public information media in the interest 
of public understanding of the Armed Forces.  
  3.2.6.   Armed Forces participation in public events.  Fees for such participation are governed 
by the provisions of DoDI 5410.19, “Public Affairs  Comm
 unity Relations Policy Implementation” .

* October 2023 
4-8  3.2.7.   Records made available to the public, under FOIA, pursuant to DoD 5400.7, “DoD 
Freedom of Information Act P rogram.”  Fees for searches and copies of records are governed by 
Chapter 6 of DoD 5400.7. 
  3.2.8.  Services furnished to non- Federal audio -visual media.  Fees for such services are 
governed by the provisions of 32 Code of Federal Regulations Part 238  (32 CFR Part 238) , “DoD 
Public Affairs Assistance to Non -Government, Entertainment -Oriented Media Productions.” 
  3.2.9.   P 
ricing of performance by DoD Working Capital Fund activities which must be in 
accordance with Volume 11B.  
  3.2.10.   Foreign Military Sales of Defense articles and services which must be in accordance 
with Volume 15.  
  3.2.11.   Records made available to requesters under the Privacy Act of 1974, pursuant to 
DoD 5400.11.  3.3 Calculation of User Fees  
  All fees must be based on th e full cost to the U.S.  Government or market price, whichever 
applies.  Additionally, w henever possible, fees must  be set as rates rather than fixed dollar amounts 
in order to adjust for changes in costs to the Government or changes in market prices of the good, resource, or service provided.  
  3.3.1.   Except as provided in paragraphs  1.3, 4.0, and 5.0 a user fee sh ould be imposed to 
recover the full cost to the Federal Government of providing the service, resource, or good when the Government is acting in its capacity as sovereign.   “Full cost” includes all direct and indirect costs 
associated with providing a good, resource, or service.  Full cost must be determined or estimated from the best available records, and new cost accounting systems should not be established solely for th is purpose.  These costs are outlined in Chapter 1 and include, but are not limited to, an 
appropriate share of:  
 
  3.3.1.1.  Direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries and fringe benefits such as medical insurance and retirement.   Retirement costs should include all (funded or 
unfunded) accrued costs not covered by employee contributions as specified in  
OMB Circular A -11. 
 
  3.3.1.2.  Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs including material and supply costs, utilities, insurance, travel, and rents or imputed rents on land, buildings, and equipment .  If imputed rental costs are applied, they should include: 
    *3.3.1.2.1.  Depreciation of structures and equipment (based on guidance 
contained in  Volume 4, Chapter 24 and 25, respectively ); and 
    3.3.1.2.2.  An annual rate of ret urn (equal to the average long -term Treasury 
bond rate) on land, structures, equipment and other capital resources used. 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 4  
* October 2023 
4-9   3.3.1.3.  The management and supervisory costs. 
   3.3.1.4.  The costs of enforcement, collection, research, establishment of standards, and regulation, including any required environmental impact statements.  
 3.3.2.  User fees should be based on market prices when the Government is not acting in 
its capacity as sovereign and is leasing or selling goods or resources, or is providing a service (e.g., leasing space in federally owned buildings).  Under these business -type conditions, user fees need 
not be limited to the recovery of full  cost, must be based on market prices, and may yield net 
revenues.  “Market price” means the price for a good, resource, or service that is based on competition in open markets, and creates neither a shortage nor a surplus of the good, resource, or service.    3.3.2.1.  When a substantial competitive demand exists for a good, resource, or service, its market price will be determined using commercial practices, for example  by: 
    3.3.2.1.1.  C ompetitive bidding; or  
    3.3.2.1.2.  R eference to prevailing pr ices in competitive markets for goods, 
resources, or services that are the same or similar to those provided by the Government (e.g., campsites or grazing lands in the general vicinity of private ones) with adjustments as appropriate that reflect demand, l evel of service, and quality of the good or service. 
   3.3.2.2.  In the absence of substantial competitive demand, market price will be determined by taking into account the prevailing prices for goods, resources, or services that are 
the same or substantially similar to those provided by the Government, and then adjusting the 
supply made available and/or price of the good, resource, or service so that there will be neither a shortage nor a surplus (e.g., campsites in remote areas).  
  3.3.3.  Fees established in advance of performance sh ould be based on the estimated cost 
of performance.  Projected amounts must  be reviewed the earlier of biennially or whenever 
significant changes in cost or value occur.  
  3.3.4.  Internal management controls must be established in accordance with OMB Circular A -123, GAO’s GAO-14-704G , and DoDI 5010.40 to en
 sure that user fees are 
developed, published on a publicly available website, and adjusted using current, accurate, and 
complete data.   These controls must also ensure compliance with cash management and debt 
collection policies promulgated in Volume 5.  3.4 Col
lection of User Fees  
  DoD Components should make every effort to keep the costs of collection to a minimum 
and collect fees electronically, via electronic funds transfer (EFT), and utilize, as applicable, the 
collection services provided by the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) as described in Volume 5, Chapter 8 and outlined in the Tre asury Financial Management , Volume  1, 
“Federal Agencies,” Part 5, “ Deposit Regulations ( 1 TFM  Part 5). ” 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 4  
* October 2023 
4-10  3.4.1.  In accordance with OMB Circular A -25, user fees must be collected in advance o f, 
or simultaneously with, the rendering of services unless appropriations and authority are provided 
to allow for services  to be provided on a reimbursable basis. 
  3.4.2.  Although fees must be collected in advance absent statutory authority to provide services or special benefits on a reimbursable  basis, Components may collect advance fee 
payments incrementally if variable costs such as personnel or utility costs are incurred 
incrementally over time and if the services or special benefit is susceptible to being provided on a severable basis.  3.5 Disposition of User Fees   
  As required by 31 U.S.C. § 3302, an official or agent of the Government who receives 
money for the Federal Government from any source must deposit the money in the Treasury as 
soon as practicable.  This law is generally referred to as the “ Miscellaneous Receipts Statute .”  
Accordingly, unless another statute provides otherwise, user fees collect ed under the authority of 
the User Charge Statute must be credited to the G eneral Fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts . 
 3.6 Exceptions or Waiving of User Fees   
  3.6.1.   The Head of each DoD Component  or designee may make exceptions to the general 
policy if the provision of a free service is an appropriate courtesy to a foreign government or international organization; or comparable fees are set on a reciprocal basis with a foreign country.  
 
 3.6.2.   The Head of each DoD Component or designee may recommend to OMB that 
exceptions to the general policy be made when:  
 
  3.6.2.1.   The cost of collecting the fees would represent an unduly large part of the 
fee for the activity; or  
   3.6.2.2.   Any other condition exists that, in the opinion of the  agency head or his 
designee, justifies an exception.  
  3.6.3.   All exceptions  must  be for a period of no more than four years unless renewed by the 
Head of each DoD Component  or designee for exceptions granted under subparagraph 3.6.1 or OMB 
for exceptions granted under subparagraph 3.6.2  after a review to determine whether conditions 
warrant their continuation.  
   3.6.4.   Requests for exceptions and extensions under paragraphs 3.6.2  and 3.6.3  must  be 
submitted to the Director of OMB.

* October 2023 
4-11 4.0 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO RETAIN AND USE FEES  
 
4.1 General Policy   
  If Components require modification of statutory prohibitions on assessment of user fee 
charges, they may propose remedial legislation to repeal the assessment prohibition or to authorize 
an exception .  Similarly, Components may propose legislative authority to retain and use amounts 
collected as user charges.  Such proposals are subject to requirements for preparation and submission established in DoD  Directive (DoDD) 5500.01, “Preparing, Processing, and 
Coordinating Legislation, Executive Orders, Proclamations, Views Letters, and Testimony .”  For 
additional guidance on submitting legislativ e proposal s for approval  or authorization to implement 
or modify  a user fee program or  to authorize retention  and use of user fee collections, refer to  
OMB Circular A -25 Revised , paragraph 7. 
 4.2 Auth 
orities   
  Under the User Charge Statute, a statutory authority  is required for  DoD Components to 
retain and use user fees.  Proposals requesting such authority may be appropriate when a user fee 
is levied in order to finance a service that is intended to be provided on a substantially self-sustaini ng basis and thus is dependent upon adequate collections. 
  4.2.1.  The authority to use fees credited to an appropriation is generally subject to limits set in annual appropriations language.  However, it may be appropriate to request exemption from annua l appropriations control, if a provision of the service is dependent on demand that is irregular 
or unpredictable (e.g., a fee to reimburse an agency for the cost of overtime pay of inspectors for 
services performed after regular duty hours).  
 
 4.2.2.  Leg islative proposals that permit fees to be credited to accounts must  be consistent 
with the full  cost recovery guidelines contained in paragraph 3.3.2.  Any fees collected in excess 
of full cost recovery (i.e., under business -type conditions in which user f ees are calculated based 
on market prices) are to be credited to the General Fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.  
 4.3 Procedures    Legislative proposals must be submitted to OMB in accordance with the requirements of  
DoDD 5500.01 and OMB Circular No . A-19, “ Legislative Coordination and Clearance ”. 
  To 
ensure the proper placement of user fee initiatives in the budget account structure, DoD Components are encouraged to discuss proposals with OMB at an early stage of development.   
Further guidance may be obtained from the DoD General Counsel Office of Legislative Counsel’s website at: https://ogc.osd.mil/OGC -Office
 s/Office -of-Legislative -Counsel/ .  Proposals to 
remove user fee restrictions or retain collections must: 
  4.3.1.  D
efine , in general terms , the services for which fees will be assessed and the pricing 
mechanism that will be used.  
 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 4  
* October 2023 
4-12  4.3.2.  Specify whether fees will be collected in advance of, or simultaneously with, the 
provision of service unless appropriations and authority are provided in advance to allow 
reimbursable services.  
  4.3.3.  Specify where collections will be credited.  Legislative proposals should not normally specify precise fees.  The user fee schedule should be set by regulation to allow for the administrative updating of fe es to reflect changing costs and market values.  
 5.0 BENEFITS FOR WHICH NO FEE MUST  BE ASSESSED

 2.0 POLICY  (0502) 
 *2.1 General Rules  for Deposit and Use of Proceeds (050201)  
  2.1.1.  In accordance with 40 U.S.C. § 571, net proceeds from sales of surplus property 
must  be deposited in the U.S. Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ) as miscellaneous receipts 
unless deposit into an alternate appropriation is authorized by law.  The law also  requires that the 
expenses of the sale of old material, condemned stores, supplies and other public property are paid from the proceeds of the sale, so that only the net proceeds are deposited in the Treasury or other applicable appropriation authorized by law.  
 
 2.1.2.  10 U.S.C. § 2210 states that proceeds of disposals of property that are  necessary to 
recover the expenses  incurred in disposing of that property may be retained by a working capital 
fund responsible for the disposal.  According ly, the Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA)  
Disposition  Services  will retain amounts sufficient to offset all expenses incurred in the disposition 
of excess/surplus personal property, out of the proceeds of sales of such property (see Table 5 -1).  
Legal exceptions to this policy affecting the Department are contained at paragraphs 050202. 
 2.2 Legal Exceptions  to the General Rules (050202) 
  The following authorizations permit the crediting of the proceeds of the sale to 
appropriations and/or funds of the Department.  Additional guidance on specific types of exceptions  is located in Table 5 -2. 
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 5   
* March 2020  
5-5  2.2.1.  Supplies, Material, Equipment, and Other Personal Property Not Financed by Stock 
Funds.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2210, the net proceeds from the sale or disposal of surplus 
property in excess of amounts necessary to recover expenses may be credited to current applicable 
appropriations of DoD.  Thus, any proceeds that remain after disposal expenses are recovered are to be credited to the current applicable appropriations of the Department (i.e., the appropriation currently available for the purchase o f such property). 
 
 2.2.2.  Revolving Fund and Non- Appropriated Fund Property.  In accordance with 
40 U.S.C. § 574, when property is acquired with amounts either (a) not appropriated from the 
general fund of the Treasury; or (b) appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue or receipts, the net proceeds of such a disposition or transfer of the property must  be: 
   2.2.2.1.  Credited to the applicable reimbursable fund or appropriation; or    2.2.2.2.  Paid to the federal agency that determined the property to be excess.  
 2.2.3.  Contractor Sales of Surplus Government Property in the Possession of Contractors .  
The DFARS  subpart 245.604, implements 40 U.S.C. § 574(c)  and provides overall direction for 
crediting proceeds from contractor conducted sales of surplus government property in the possession of contractors. 
   2.2.3.1.  The contractor making the sale may follow normal company policy on bid 
deposits and form of payment.  However, any loss associated with a dishonored payment is  the 
contractor’s  responsibility . 
   2.2.3.2.  The plant clearance officer appointed by the contracting administration 
office , consistent with  DFARS subpart 245.70, is responsible for notifying the appropriate 
accounting office of the amounts collected by the contractor.  The plant clearance officer also must  
notify the accounting office of the disposition of such collections.  Specifically, collections may:     2.2.3.2.1.  Represent an increase in the dollar value of the applicable 
contract(s).  
    2.2.3.2.2.  Be applied in place of disbursements on the applicable 
contract(s).  
    2.2.3.2.3.  Be returned to the applicable Component’s Working C apital 
Fund ( 097X4930, wh ere 097 is the agency identifier code for DoD and X represents a no-year 
fund) in the case of inventory purchased with Working C apital Funds , or deposited in the 
miscellaneous receipt account, “Sale of Scrap and Salvage Materials, Defense,” ( 097_2651). 
   2.2.3.3.  The accounting office for the contract is identified in the accounting 
citation.  That office must  prepare the source documents nec essary to account properly for the 
transaction.

5-6 * 2.2.4.  Sales of Recyclable Material on Military Installations .  Distribution of proceeds , by 
DoD installations or DLA Disposition Services, from direct sales of installation qualified recycling 
programs (QRP ) is covered by 10 U.S.C. § 2577 and DoD I 4715.23. 
   2.2.4.1.  The Director, DLA and DLA Disposition Services  (under the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment ) must  establish procedures and 
controls to ensure that when recyclable materials are consigned for disposal to DLA Disposition  Services  on behalf of a qualified recycling program, 100 percent of any 
proceeds, less the costs of sales and handling, are returned to installations in accordance with 
established accounting procedures.    2.2.4.2.  An accounting and control system must  be established for recycling 
programs that provides detailed management and audit information, tracks material quantity handled, calculates sales and handling costs for recycled material, and tracks expenditures made for appropriate projects and Morale, Welfare and Recreation  (MWR ) programs.  Integrity of the 
audit trail must be a priority concern.    2.2.4.3.  If after such funds are cred ited and a balance remains available to a 
military installation and such installation has a QRP  (as determined by the Secretary of the 
Military  Department concerned or the Secretary of Defense), not more than 50 percent of  that

 3.1 Types of Bid Deposits (050301)   When a DoD sale of surplus personal property conducted by a  DoD Component provides 
for a bid deposit with subsequent removal of the surplus personal property, the following definitions must be applied:  
 
 3.1.1.  Term Bid .  This type of bid deposit is applicable when the sale involves the purchase 
of scrap or disposable material that will be generated over time with periodic removal by the successful bidder.  The normal amount of the bid deposit required to accompany such bids is the average estimated quantity of such material to be generated during a three -month period multiplied 
by 20 percent of the bid price. 
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 5   
* March 2020  
5-8  3.1.2.  Other Than Term Bid.  With the exception of term bids, payment in the normal 
amount of 20 percent of the bid must  accompany the bid. 
 
 3.1.3.  Immediate Pickup Terms.   When a sale conducted by a DoD Component provides 
for immediate pickup, the entire amount of the sales price must  be collected from the buyer at the 
conclusion of the sale.  If the sale provides for a bid deposit, the balance of the bid price must  be 
paid before removal of the property. 
 
3.2 Forms of Payment (050302)  
 3.2.1.  Cash and Cash  Equivalents.  Cash or cash equivalents in the prescribed amounts 
must  accompany the bid, if required by the sales solicitation.  For one -time contracts, cash or cash 
equivalents for the balance due must  be received by the DoD Components or, in authorized cases, 
by contractors before the transfer of physical possession to the successful bidder.  Cash equivalents are guaranteed negotiable instruments, such as cashiers’ checks, cert ified checks , traveler ’s checks, 
or postal money orders. 
 
 3.2.2.  Personal Checks.   Personal checks may be accepted by a DoD Component only 
when a bank guarantee, bid bond or a bank letter of credit is on hand that will cover the  amount 
due.  If the check is dishonored, amounts due must  be collected from the issuer of the guarantee, 
bond, or letter of credit. 
   3.2.2.1.  If a bidder intends to use a bond or letter of credit without an accompanying personal check (permitted for bid deposits only), the claim against the performance bond or letter of credit must  be made for any amounts due. 
   3.2.2.2.  If personal checks are used, the bond or letter of credit must  be returned 
intact after the applicable personal checks are honored, unless other instructions have been received from the bidder.  
 3.2.3.  Credit Cards/Debit Cards.   As specified herein, credit or debit cards may be accepted 
by a DoD Component for payment. 
   3.2.3.1.  Policies governing acceptance under the Card Acquiring Service ( CAS )
 by 
DoD Components are established in Volume 5, Chapter 11, “Electronic Commerce and Deposit 
of Public Funds .”  Transaction limits do apply in these instances, for further guidance see 
Volume 5, Chapter 11. 
 *  3.2.3.2.  CAS  is a Treasury , Bureau of the Fiscal Service program that provides 
federal agencies payment card acceptance capabilities. Federal agencies can collect most remittance obligations through debit and credit cards.  CAS is also a card neutral program that 
accepts cards from all the major network brands.  Changes or additions to approved credit or debit 
cards are announced in Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) memoranda, or in changes to the TFM.   Except for equipment and communication costs, Treasury pays any fees 
normally charged to sellers.  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 5   
* March 2020  
5-9   3.2.3.3.  If a credit or debit card is used for the bid deposit, and authorization is 
declined, the bid may be rejected as nonresponsive and other bidders considered.  3.3 Disposition of Bid Deposits (050303)   3.3.1.  If the sale provides for a bid deposit, cash collected from bidders initially must  be 
deposited by a DoD Component to account 097X6501, “Small Escrow Amounts,”  until such time 
as a successful bidder has been determined and a contract has been award ed. 
  3.3.2.  Unsuccessful Bidders  
   3.3.2.1.  A check must  be drawn on account 097X6501, “Small Escrow Amounts,” 
to reimburse unsuccessful bidders for their cash bid deposits.    3.3.2.2.  Normally, noncash bid deposits must  be returned to unsuccessful bidders 
by DoD Components through the mail.  There are some exceptions such as:  
    3.3.2.2.1.  When a bidder appears in person, normally the noncash instrument may be released to the bidder or an agent designated for this purpose.     3.3.2.2.2.  W hen a bidder has requested expedited return and has provided 
the name of a carrier and a charge account number, the designated carrier must  be called to pick 
up the deposit with the explicit condition that applicable carrier costs will be charged to the bidder’s account.   3.3.3.  Successful Bidder  
   3.3.3.1.  A bid deposit of the successful bidder must  be transf erred promptly from 
the account  097X6501, “Small Escrow Amounts,” to the account(s) prescribed in accordance with 
this chapter.  
   3.3.3.2.  The DLA Disposition Services  either must  retain the bid deposit or charge 
a specific penalty for buyer defaults on sales contracts.  
 3.4 Disposition of Proceeds Received from Successful Bidders (050304)   If the account, ultimately to be credited with the proceeds of a sale reasonably can be 
determined at the time funds are collected from the successful bidder and by law can receive reimbursement,  the amounts collected must  be deposited immediately to that account.  The use of 
suspense accounts is prohibited.

A-7 GENERAL  
 
Department of Defense Service Academies’ Foreign Cadet Reimbursable Rate is to be used when billing foreign cadets and midshipmen instruction cost. Title 10, United States Code, Section 347 requires a Foreign Government to reimburse instruction costs to the United States for cadets and midshipmen permitted to attend one of the military academies to include the United States Military Academy, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy.  Each Service Department calculates its internal Service Academies’ For eign Cadet Reimbursable Rate using the rate calculation in the 
instructions.  OUSD(C) calculates the Department of Defense Service Academies’ Foreign Cadet Reimbursable Rate from the Services’ submissions and publishes on the OUSD(C) public website prior t o the commencement of the academies’ academic year.   
 Instructions:    Instruction costs include faculty, staff, learning material, housing, basic pay and allowance, subsistence (meals), and medical expenses of a cadet/midshipman.  The instruction costs a re 
identified in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M), Military Personnel (MILPER), and Other Procurement (OP) appropriations.  Detailed instructions for calculating the Services’ foreign cadet and midshipman reimbursable rate follows:  (1) Insert the applicable current year (CY) and budget year (BY) for the fiscal year being 
calculated. For example, when computing the FY 2020 Budget Year rate, the current year would be FY 2019 and the budget year would be FY 2020.    (2) Include all budgeting and programmi ng data in the Service Academies Program Element 
(PE) 804721 for all appropriations.  The Service Academy PE shall be exclusively used for cadet and midshipman instruction cost.  The O&M appropriation must include the PE, budget activity, and subactivity group for instruction cost.   For the O&M and OP accounts the current year reflects the enacted appropriation and the budget year reflects the President’s Budget.  In the MILPER accounts CY shall reflect the CY Estimate (i.e., not the enacted) in the BY President's Budget and BY shall reflect the BY in the BY President's Budget. When there is no enactment of an appropriation, the CY is an estimate for all appropriations.   (3) Insert the Cadet/Midshipman workyears/average strength which includes Foreign Cade ts 
(Basic Pay, Average Number) shown in the Military Personnel justification books for budget activity 3, Pay and Allowances for Cadets/Midshipmen submitted to the Congress in support of the President’s Budget.  The workyears/average strength CY column sha ll reflect the CY Estimate 
in the BY President’s Budget and BY shall reflect the BY in the BY President’s Budget.  (4) Obtain the Cadet/Midshipman medical support cost from the OUSD(C).  The Service 
Academies’ Cadet/Midshipman medical support costs include both clinic and hospital costs.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) shall provide a cost per capita for the CY and BY, by Academy to the Director, for Operations Directorate, OUSD(C), Room 3C749, the Pentagon, 30 days after the submission of the President’s Budget to the Congress. This amount will be calculated by multiplying the per capita cost provided by the OASD(HA) by the sum of the cadet/midshipman workyears/average strength included in the President’s budget.

A-8  
(5) Mu ltiply the number of cadet workyears/average strength by the medical support costs per 
capita rate to get the total Medical charge for the academy.  
 (6) Sum the Service Academies PE (804721) cost, the total medical charge Program Element cost, and medical support cost.  (7)  Divide the Total Costs (6) by Cadet/Midshipman workyears/average strength (3).  (8) Sum 1/3 of the cost per cadet/midshipman for the CY and 2/3 of the CY cost per cadet/midshipman for the BY.

RATE  
 
 
 
Stabilized customer rates and reimbursement to the Military Personnel accounts are not based on 
the above rates.  Rather, such amounts are based on the absolute total dollar amount specified in 
the President’s budget (rather than based on the number, or military composite rate, of individuals actually assigned).  Guidance on  calculating, paying (reimbursing), recording and reporting 
DWCF military personnel costs is contained in Volume 2B, Chapter 9, Section 090103 and 
Volume 11B, Chapter 12, Section 1202 of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) 
(DoD 7000.14- R).

 The Department of Defense Working Capital Funds civilian/military equivalency rate will 
be calculated as follows:  
  1.  Use the generic (Rest of U.S.)  pay amount for Step 5 of each appropriate General 
Schedule (GS) civilian grade, or the applicable Executive Service (ES) pay level, as applicable, from the c urrent civilian pay schedules. 
  2.  Add as required, the applicable portion (pro- rata) of the pro posed pay raise, if any, for 
civilians (GS/ES) that was effective for the budget fiscal year, and   3.  Add the average civilian personnel fringe benefits factor applicable to the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The amount for unfunded civilian retirement is not to be included in the fringe benefits percentage factor. Civilian personnel fringe benefit rates are provided by the OUSD (Comptroller) and published on the Comptroller website.

D-13 APPENDIX D:  CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION SERVICES  
 
 Contract administration services (CAS) hourly reimbursable billing rates should be applied to direct labor hours incurred in 
support of CAS efforts.  These CAS rates are to be used in billing other Federal Agencies, the public, and Foreign Military Sa les (FMS) 
customers.  FMS customers are to be billed in accordance with subsections 070406 and 080601 of Volume 15, “Security Assis tance 
Policy and Procedures,” of this Regulation.  Waivers and exclusions are to be granted in accordance with subsection 070104 of 
Volume 15. 
 
 
 
 
NOTES:  
(1) Use the Budget Year “Gross Cost Per Direct Hour” amount from page 2.   (2) Sum Budget Year lines C, E, and G from page 2 and multiply the resultant amount by .167 (obtained from OMB Circular No. A 76 
Revised Supplemental Handbook, “Performance of Commercial Activities”).  That product then is divided by the applicable total  
direct work -hours (line V from page 2) to derive an hourly unfunded civilian retirement cost.  The resultant hourly unfunded civilian 
retirement cost is added to the “Other Federal Agencies Rate” (column 1) to yield the FMS rate.

(The civilian fringe benefit rate --to be used in this calculation --will be obtained annually from the 
OUSD(C), Program/Budget, Operations Directorate, 3C749, the Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301- 1100) for any civilian personnel costs included in (4), (5), (6), (7) or (8). Location of 
calculation instructions in this appendix are indicated by the number in parenthesis before the name of the cost category.    (8) Fuel costs will be equal to the corresponding amounts shown in the related OP-20 Exhibit 
series (OP -20D for Army, OP -20 for Navy, and OP -20E for Air Force) for the applicable 
type/model/series.  (If for any reason, the OP -20 Exhibit series does not include an applicable 
type/model/series of aircraft, fu el costs will be computed using the same methodology as that used 
for aircraft included in the OP -20 Exhibit series, i.e., by dividing the total cost of fuel for the fiscal 
year for each type of aircraft by the total number of flying hours for that same ai rcraft.)  Services 
should also include fuel costs for non- fly fuel directly supporting the flying hour program (such as 
fuel used in engine test cells and auxiliary powers units).  (9) Depot- level reparable (DLR) costs will be equal to the corresponding amounts shown in 
the related OP -20 Exhibit series (OP -20D for Army, OP -20 for Navy, and OP -20E for Air Force) 
for the applicable type/model/series.  (If for any reason, the OP -20 Exhibit series does not include 
an applicable type/model/series of aircraft, DL R costs will be computed using the same 
methodology as that used for aircraft included in the OP -20 Exhibit series, i.e., by dividing the

* November 2019 
F-23 total DLR costs for the applicable fiscal year by the total number of flying hours for that same 
aircraft.)  
(10) Inclu de an hourly rate for depot maintenance cost for airframes, engines, and components 
for the applicable type/model/series.  This cost will be an average cost for that type/model/series, and be computed by dividing the total amount of depot maintenance budgeted for the applicable type/model/series by the number of flying hours budgeted for that type/model/series.   (11) Other costs will equal corresponding “other” amounts shown in the related OP -20 Exhibit 
series (OP -20D for Army, OP -20 for Navy, and OP -20E f or Air Force --for Air Force, this is equal 
to the consumables required in Exhibit OP -20E).  (If for any reason, the OP -20 Exhibit series does 
not include an applicable type/model/series of aircraft, other costs will be computed using the same methodology as that used for aircraft included in the OP -20 Exhibit series, i.e., by adding all 
operating costs ((other than fuel, DLRs, depot maintenance, crew salary, and asset utilization)) and dividing the total of such other costs for the applicable fiscal year by the total number of flying 
hours.)  If for any reason the OP -20 Exhibit does not include detail for contract logistics support, 
use a five-year average of variable CLS or equivalent costs and hours.  (12) Crew salary amounts will be computed based on the number and grade of military 
personnel operating the aircraft.  Crew salary costs will be computed by:    (a) Multiplying the standard number of crew members in each applicable 
military grade times the annual Military Standard Composite Rate for that grade  available on the 
reimbursable rates page of the OUSD(C) website: (https://comptroller.defense.gov/Financial -
Management/Reports/rates2022/).  NOTE:  For Federal Agencies and Public rates, use the applicable rates in the “Annual Rate Billable to Other Feder al Agencies” column.  For the FMS 
rate, use the applicable rate in the “Annual DoD Composite Rate” column plus the annual acceleration factor.  
   (b) Dividing the result of (a) by 2080 (hours) to convert the annual rate to an 
hourly rate, by grade.    (c) Multiplying the results of (b) by a factor of 1.14 percent for both officers 
and enlisted personnel.  (This calculation increases the hourly rate by 14 percent for officers and enlisted personnel fringe benefits.)    (d) Adding the amounts arrived at in (c) for each grade, to arrive at a total hourly 
rate for the entire crew.  
 NOTE:  The computation of crew salary amounts should be supported by a separate table attached to this exhibit.  
 (13) The asset utilization amount will be computed by applying an asse t utilization factor of 4 
percent times the sum of columns (8) --Fuel, (9) --DLRs, (10) --Depot Maintenance, (11) --Other and  
(12)--Crew Salary for each specific aircraft.  
 (14) Provide a brief narrative to explain significant changes between fiscal years.

MEDICAL AND DENTAL SERVICES RATE COMPUTATION 
 
SUBMITTED BY THE OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
(HEALTH AFFAIRS)  
 
Note:  Budget exhibit includes Inpatient, Outpatient, Pharmacy and other rates.  This exhibit is to 
be included only in the President’s budget.  The format of the budget exhibit for medical , dental , 
and pharmacy rates may vary slightly from year to year due to the addition/deletion of rates, 
changes in nomenclature, updated notes , and other unforeseen reasons. The tables below are for 
informational purposes only. 
 
INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT AND OTHER RATES AND CHARGES  
 
1.0 *Inpatient Rates  
  Direct Care Inpatient Adjusted Standardized Amounts (ASA) rates are computed based on 
the Military Health System (MHS) direct care standardized cost to provide a single Medicare Severity Relative Weighted Product (MS -RWP).  The MS -RWP is a Medicare Severit y Diagnosis 
Related Group (MS -DRG) based measure of the relative costliness of a given discharge.  The 
average standardized cost per MS -RWP for hospitals in locations with area wage rates greater than 
1.0, less than or equal to 1.0, and overseas are published annually as inpatient ASAs shown in Table 1.  This approach maintains compatibility with both Medicare and TRICARE ASA policies.  The ASA rates will be applied to the MS -RWP for each inpatient case, determined from the 
TRICARE MS -DRG weights, outlier thresholds, and payment rules to calculate the reimbursement 
charge.  The Department of Defense (DoD) publishes this data annually for hospital reimbursement rates under TRICARE/Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services pursuant to 32 Code of Federal Regulations 199.14(a)(1).  Due to data system limitations, for military treatment facilities (MTFs), direct care adjustments are made for length of stay (LOS) outliers rather than high cost outliers.    The example below  provides the average direct care inpatient ASA rates for third party 
billing, interagency billing, and International Military Education and Training (IMET) billing for three core -based statistical areas (CBSA) (high area wage index, low area wage index, and 
overseas).

  The IMET program is a key funding component of U.S. security assistance that provides 
training on a grant basis to students from allied and friendly nations.  Authority for the IMET program is found pursuant to Chapter 5, part II, Foreign Assistance Act 1961.  Funding is appropriated from the International Affairs budget of the Department of State.  Not all foreign national patients participate in the IMET program.  The IAR ASA rates are used to bill other federal agencies.  The full/Third Party Collection (TPC) ASA rates are used to bill insurance carriers, pay patients, and other payers.     Each MTF providing inpatient care has its own applied ASA rates (shown in Appendix A).  
The MTF -specific ASA rates are the average ASA rates adjusted for indirect medical education 
costs, if any, for the discharging hospital.  The product of the discharge specific MS -RWP and the 
MTF -applied ASA rate is the charge submitted on the claim and is the amount payers will use for 
reimbursement purposes.  The individual ASAs are published on the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Uniform Business Office (UBO) Website (
http://health.mil/Military -Health -
Topics/Business-Support/Uniform-Busine ss-Office ).  
  The ASA per MS -RWP used in the direct care system is comparable to procedures used by 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and TRICARE.  The expenses represented by the ASAs include all direct care expenses associated with direct inpatient care.  The inpatient ASAs includes the cost of both inpatient professional and institutional services.  The ASA rates apply to reimbursement from TPC, IMET and IAR payers.  Pursuant to the provisions of 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1095, the breakdown of total inpatient charges is 93 percent for institutional charges and seven (7) percent for professional charges.  When preparing bills for inpatient services, professional fees are based on the privileged provider services.  The hospital institutional fees are based on the costs for support staff, facility costs, ancillary services, pharmacy, and supplies.    MTFs without inpatient services, whose providers perform inpatient care in a civilian 
facility for a DoD beneficiary, may bill payers the percentage o f the ASA/MS -RWP based charge 
that represents professional services.  In the absence of a MTF -applied ASA rate for the facility, 
the ASA rate used will be based on the average for the type of CBSA in which the MTF is located - areas with wage rate indices greater than 1.0, less than or equal to 1.0, or overseas.  The MTF 
UBO must  receive documentation of care provided in order to produce an appropriate bill.

2.0 *Outpatient Rates  
  Outpatient Rates are the charges for professional and institutional health care services 
provided in MTFs financed by the Defense Health Program Appropriation. These rates are used to submit claims for reimbursement of the costs of the health care services provided by MTF s in 
accordance with the various MTF Cost Recovery Programs: Medical Services Account (MSA), Third Party Collections and Medical Affirmative Claims.  
  Outpatient Rates consists of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed 
Services (CHAMPUS) Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC) Rate Tables (modified for UBO use); Dental Rates; Immunization/Injectable Rates; Anesthesia Rates; and Durable Medical Equipment/Durable Medical Supplies (DME/DMS) Rates  
  Outpatient Rates are updated annually on a Calendar Year  (CY) basis, with an effective date 
of 1 July.  The actual rate tables are not included in this section, due to size.  The current CY Outpatient rates are on the Defense Health Agency (DHA)Management Control & Financial Studies Uniform Business Office (UBO ) Web site

CMAC  Rates  
 Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC)  Rates, established under Title 32, Sec. 199.14(j) of the Code of 
Federal Regulations, are used to determine the appropriate charge for the professional and technical components of services based on the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) met hodology, which includes the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) codes. DHA 
UBO CMAC rates differ from standard TRICARE CMAC rates in that DHA UBO CMAC rates 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation      Volume 11A, Chapter 6 Appendix F  
* November 2019 
F-27 are formatted for legacy military billing systems and include charges for additional services no t 
reimbursed by TRICARE. DHA UBO CMAC rates pertain to professional services (e.g., office 
and clinic visits), ancillary services (e.g., laboratory and radiology) and OBS professional services.  
 DHA UBO CMAC rates are calculated for distinct “localities”. These localities recognize 
differences in local costs to provide health care services in the different geographic regions in which MTFs are located. Each MTF Defense Military Information System Identification  
(DMIS  ID) is mapped to its corresponding CMAC l ocality code to obtain the correct rates. For all 
MTFs located outside the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii, the national average CMAC locality file (300) is used except for Guam and Puerto Rico which have their own CMAC localities. The comple te DMIS ID -to-CMAC Locality table is available on the DHA UBO Website 
at 
https://health.mil/Military -Health -Topics/Business-Support/Uniform-Business- Office/UBO -
Rates -Overview/MHS -UBO -Rates   
 For each CMAC locality, the DHA UBO creates two sub -tables of rates: CMAC and 
Component. The CMAC rate table specifies the rates to use as payment for professional services and procedures identified by CPT® and HCPCS codes, which cannot be separately provided as professional and technical component services. The Component rate table specifies which rates to use for CPT® codes which can be provided as distinct professional and technical components, or as a combined professional and technical service. A separate rate is provided for each component. Both CMAC and Component rate tables are further categorized by CHCS provider class. The four provider classes are: 1) Physicians, 2) Psychologists, 3) Other Mental Health Providers, and 4) Other Medical Providers. UBO CMAC rates for billing of professional services are available on the DHA UBO Website at

Dental Rates: 
 The UBO Dental Rate Table consists of MTF dental charges based on a flat rate multiplied by 
the DoD established dental weighted value (DWV) for each American Dental Association (ADA)  
Current Dental Terminology (CDT) procedure code.  The dental flat rate for a particular code 
represents the average DoD cost of dental services at all dental treatment facilities.  The table below provides the dental code, clinical service/procedure name, the DoD weighted value, the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, Interagency Rate (IOR) and Full Outpatient Rate (FOR) dental charges.

Immunization/Injectable Rates:  
 Immunization or injectable rate charges are applicable for any administered immunization, 
injection or medication in the MTFs.  UBO Immunization rates are based on T RICARE rates when  
available.  If there is no TRICARE rate available, Purchased Care Data is  used to derive rates.  
Rates are derived from Purchased Care Data by using the Military Health System Management Analysis and Reporting Tool or M2 system.  This reporting tool allows for querying and detailed trend analysis including summaries and detaile d views of population, clinical, and financial data 
from all MHS regions worldwide.  Data pulled from previous and current FY (to date) allows calculation of average amount allowed for rate use. Outlier rates are adjusted using historical 
Purchased Care Data of up to five (5) years.

3.0 Pharmacy Rates 
  Pharmacy rates are established on a unit measure price basis (e.g., cost per tablet) and are 
standardized for N ational Drug Codes (NDCs)  within each generic sequence number (GSN). 
Pharmacy rates are derived from the Managed Care Pricing File (MCPF) and are based on 
TRICARE allowable charges, Average Wholesale Price (AWP) or Prime V endor Program (PVP) 
prices listed for the NDCs  in the MCPF.  R ates are computed based on the median unit measure 
cost for all of the listed AWP NDCs in each GSN group. The median unit measure price is applied 
to all the NDCs in that GSN group.   CPT® Code  Rate Short Description  Long Description

4.0 *Cosmetic Surgery  
  Elective cosmetic procedures are not  TRICARE covered benefits.  Elective cosmetic 
procedures provided in MTFs are restricted to TRICARE -eligible beneficiaries, including 
TRICARE for Life, on a “space -available” basis.  Patients receiving elective cosmetic procedures 
(e.g., Active Duty personnel, retirees, family members, and survivors) are responsible for charges for all services (including implants, injectables, anesthesia, and other separately billable items) associated with elective cosmetic procedures.  A list of elective cosmetic procedures and their associated rates can be found on the DHA UBO Website at 
https://health.mil/Military -Health -
Topics/Business-Support/Uniform-Business- Office/UBO -Rates -Overview/MHS -UBO- Rates   
 
Professional Charges for Elective Cosmetic Procedures: 
  Professional charges for elective cosmetic procedures are based on the CMAC national 
average when available.  When CMAC allowable charges are not available, charges are determined based on estimates of the medical resources required relative to procedures that have CMAC pricing.  Professional charges for elective cosmetic procedures are applied in both inpatient and ambulatory settings.  Elective cosmetic charges are not adjusted for the treating MTF’s geographical location. 
 CMAC CY 2018 “facility physician” allowable charges are used for the professional 
component for services furnished by a provider in a hospital operating room or designated 
Ambulatory Procedure Unit (APU).  CMAC  “non- facility physician” allowable charges are used 
for the professional component for services furnished in a provider’s office.    
Institutional Charges for Elective Cosmetic Procedures: 
 Institutional charges for elective cosmetic procedures are based on the procedure 
performed and the location of the service provided (i.e., provider’s office/minor surgery room, hospital operating room (either on an outpatient or inpatient basis), operating room of a MTF that is not a hospital (i.e., does not provide inpatient services). 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation      Volume 11A, Chapter 6 Appendix F  
* November 2019 
F-32  For elective cosmetic procedures conducted in a provider’s office/minor surgery room, the 
institutional fee is included in the “non-facility physician” professional charge.   
• The institutional charge for elective cosmetic procedures performed in a hospital operating 
room on an outpatient basis is based on the APV flat rate for the primary procedure with no 
additional institutional charge for bilateral or additional procedur es. 
• The institutional charge for elective cosmetic procedures performed in an operating room of a 
facility that is not a hospital is also based on the APV flat rate for the primary procedure with 
no additional institutional charge for bilateral or additional procedures.  
• The institutional charge for an elective cosmetic procedure performed in a hospital on an inpatient basis is calculated by multiplying the FY 2018 TRICARE Adjusted Standardized Amount (ASA), by the relative weighted product (RWP) associated with the Diagnostic 
Related Group (DRG).   
 If an elective cosmetic procedure is combined with a medically necessary procedure during 
the same surgical visit, the elective cosmetic procedure charge is adjusted to avoid duplicate institutional charges. The institutional charge, for an elective cosmetic procedure, when combined with a medically necessary procedure is reduced by 50 percent from the initial charge. 
 Most ancillary services (e.g., laboratory, radiology, and routine pre -operative testing) are 
included in the institutional pricing methodology described above.  Ancillary services and supplies 
not included are billed at the FOR.  
 
Anesthesia Charges for Elective Cosmetic Procedures  
  Anesthesia rates associated with elective cosmetic procedures include anesthesia 
professional services.  Anesthesia charges are calculated using the current  national anesthesia 
conversion factor, multiplied by the sum of base units and national average time units (measured in 15- minute increments) of the primary procedure. An additional anesthesia charge, based on 
additional minutes of service, is added for secondary procedures performed during the same surgical encounter.  Anesthesia charges are applied in both inpatient and ambulatory settings. Due to the large size of the cosmetic surgery rate table, a format example is not included. The current CY DME/DMS Rate table is published on the DHA UBO Web site:

G-34 MILITARY COMPOSITE STANDARD PAY AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES  
 
INSTRUCTIONS  
 
 Each Military Service must complete an Appendix G  using the attached standard format.  The heading to each Appendix G 
consists of three lines.  The first line identifies the appendix by number, the second line states “MILITARY COMPOSITE STANDA RD 
PAY AND REIMBURSABLE RATES,” and the third line identifies the Military Service that has developed the rates and the fiscal year that the rates will be used.  
  The Military Composite Standard Pay and Reimbursement Rates exhibit for the Budget Year should include the following cost 
elements that are listed for each  column of the report.  Amounts listed shall be equal to corresponding amounts contained in the applicable 
Military Service’s justification book in support of their military personnel appropriation budget request included in the lat est President’s 
budget:  
 (Column l)  Basic Pay .  Include the average basic pay amounts, by pay grade, as provided in the President's budget justification, 
Budget Subactivity (BSA) 1- A, Pay and Allowance of Officers, BSA 2- A, Pay and Allowances of Enlisted Personnel, and BSA 3- A, 
Pay and Allowances of Cadets and Midshipmen.  The cadet and midshipmen rate is computed as a single rate for all cadets/midshipmen.  NOTE:  Basic Pay for O -7 to O-10 pay grades is limited by Level II of the Executive Schedule. 
 
 (Column 2)   Retired Pay Accrual .  Include average retired pay accrual amounts, by pay grade, as provided in the President's 
budget justification, BSA 1- B, Retired Pay Accrual for Officers and BSA 2 -B, Retired Pay Accrual of Enlisted.  The applicable retired 
pay accrual percentage i s statutory and published annually. 
 
 (Column 3) Basic Allowance for Subsistence. Compute the basic allowance for subsistence rate separately, for officers and 
enlisted personnel, by pay grade, and for cadets and midshipmen, using amounts from the President's budget justification books.  The officer rate is computed by dividing BSA 1- G, Basic Allowance for Subsistence for officers, by the officer average strength, by grade.  
The enlisted rate is computed by adding BSA  4-A, Basic Allowance for Subsistence for enlisted, BSA 4 -B, Subsistence -in-Kind (SIK) 
for enlisted and BSA 4- C, Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA), and then dividing the total by the enlisted average 
strength, by grade.  Compute a single rate for cadets and midshipmen. 
  
DoD 7000.14-R  Financial Management Regulation   Volume 11A, Chapter 6 Appendix G  
*November 2019 
G-35  (Column 4)   Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH).  Compute the BAH rate separately, for officers and enlisted personnel, by 
pay grade, using amounts from the President's budget justification books.  The officer rate is computed by dividing BSA 1- F, BAH for 
officers by the average strength for officer personnel.  The enlisted rate is computed by dividing BSA 2- K, BAH for enlisted by the 
average strength for enlisted personnel. 
 
 (Column 5)  Incentive and Special Pays .  Compute the Incentive and Special Pay rate  separately for officers and enlisted 
personnel, by pay grade, using amounts from the President's budget justification books.  For each pay grade, add the incentive and 
special pay amounts and then divide the sum by the average end strength, separately for  officers and enlisted personnel.  The officer rate 
is computed by adding the amounts for BSA 1- D, Incentive Pay for officers and BSA 1- E, Special Pay for officers, then dividing the 
sum by the average strength for officer personnel.  The enlisted rate is computed by adding the amounts for BSA 2 -D, Incentive Pay for 
enlisted, BSA 2- E, Special Pay for enlisted, BSA 2- F, Special Duty Assignment Pay for enlisted, BSA 2- G, Reenlistment Bonus, BSA 
2-H, Enlistment Bonus, BSA 2- I, Education Benefits (College Fund) , and BSA 2 -J, Loan Repayment Program, then dividing the sum 
by the average strength for enlisted personnel. 
 
 (Column 6)  Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Expense.  This element represents the average cost of amounts provided in the 
President’s budget justification books for PCS travel, Budget Activity 5.  Compute the average PCS by adding the following types of travel each for officers, enlisted personnel, and cadets, from the BSAs contained in the justification books:  accession trav el (BSA 5 -A); 
training travel (BSA 5- B); operational travel between duty stations (within CONUS and within overseas) (BSA  5-C); rotational travel 
to and from overseas (BSA 5- D); separation travel (BSA 5 -E); and travel of organized units (BSA 5- F).  The sum of BA -5 is divided by 
the average strength separately, for officer and enlisted personnel.  Compute a single rate for cadets and midshipmen. 
 
 (Column 7)   Miscellaneous Expense.  This rate is the average computed separately, for officers and enlisted personnel, by pay 
grade,  and for cadets and midshipmen, of amounts provided in the President's budget justification books for Budget Activity 6, Other  
Military Personnel Costs, and other amounts for miscellaneous allowances and payments for officers, enlisted, and cadets/mids hipm en 
as contained in BSAs listed in the following matrix:

 (Column 8)  Medicare -Eligible Retiree Health Care (MERHC) Acc rual.  The annual rate is provided in OUSD(Comptroller) 
budget guidance and covers the cost of future health care benefits for current officer and enlisted personnel once they retir e and become 
Medicare- eligible, as well as their dependents and annuitants.  It does not apply to cadets and midshipmen.  See Volume 12, Chapter  16, 
Paragraph 160406, for additional information about Reimbursements of MERHC.   
 
 (Column 9)   Acceleration Factor .  This rate is provided by the OUSD(Comptroller) and covers the medical health care costs of 
active duty personnel and their dependents associated with the Defense Health Program.  It does not apply to cadets and midshipmen.   
 
 (Column 10)   Annual DoD Composite Standard Rate.  This rate shall be used when determining the military personnel 
appropriations cost for budget/management studies, but should not be considered as a fully- burdened costs of military personnel for the 
purposes of workforce -mix decisions.  Enter the sum of columns (l) through (8).  Note: Rate s include a per capita normal cost for 
MERHC accruals since MERHC accruals are counted as part of the Military Departments’ discretionary budget authority.

G-37  (Column 11)  Amount Billable to DoD Ent ities.   This rate shall be used when obtaining reimbursement for services provided to 
entities side of the DoD.  See Volume 11A, Chapter 1, Paragraph 010203, for billing DoD entities.  Add columns (1) through (7).  Note: 
Rates exclude the per capita normal  cost of MERHC accruals.  Beginning with FY 2006, MERHC accruals are paid from the General 
Fund of the Treasury and cannot be reimbursed to the Services’ personnel accounts during the year of execution. 
 
 (Column 1 2)  Amount Billable to Other Federal Agencies .  This rate shall be used when obtaining reimbursement for services 
provided to other federal agencies outside of the DoD.  Add columns  (9) and (11).  Note:  Rates include an acceleration factor to cover 
medical costs of active duty person nel and their dependents.  Reimbursements of the acceleration factor shall be deposited into the 
Defense Health Program (97*0130).  Rates exclude the per capita normal cost of MERHC accruals.  Beginning with FY 2006, MERHC  
accruals are paid from the General Fund of the Treasury and cannot be reimbursed to the Services’ personnel accounts during the year 
of execution.  Military labor shall be charged to non- DoD organization on the basis of actual hours worked or assigned (detailed). To 
compute a daily rate, multiply column ( 12) by a factor of .00452  (1.18/260.875).  For an hourly rate, multiply column ( 12) by a factor 
of .00057 (1.18/2087).   This represents a leave/holiday factor of 1 8%.  This factor compensates for wages paid during leave or holiday 
period, and is only applicable when reimbursements are based on time actually worked.  (Do not use this factor if the assignm ent is full 
time.)  
 
 (Column 13)  Amount Billable to Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Entities .   This rate shall be used when obtaining reimbursement 
for services provide to FMS Entities.   Add columns (8) and (12).   Note:   Title 22, United States Code, Section 2761(a)(1)( C) of the 
Arms Export Control Act requires foreign countries or international organizations, in the case of the sale of a defense service, to pay “the full cost to the United States Government of furnishing such service”.  Therefore the acceleration factor and the per capita normal cost for MERHC accruals shall be included in the  DoD Annual Rate Billable to FMS.  Reimbursement of the acceleration factor shall 
be deposited into the Defense Health Program (97*0130).  Reimbursement of the per capita normal cost for MERHC accrual shall be 
deposited into the Miscellaneous Receipts Acco unt 3041.  See Volume 12, Chapter 16, Paragraph 160406, for addition information 
about Reimbursements of MERHC.  Military labor shall be charged to non- DoD organization on the basis of actual hours worked or 
assigned (detailed).  To compute a daily rate, multiply column (13) by a factor of .00452 (1.18/260.875).  For an hourly rate, multiply column (13) by a factor of .00057 (1.18/2087).  This represents a leave/holiday factor of 18%.  This factor compensates for wages pai d 
during leave or holiday period, and is only applicable when reimbursements are based on time actually worked.  (Do not use this factor if the assignment is full time.)

INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL PROGRAM  
 
*1.0 GENERAL  
 1.1 Overview 
  The DoD’s International Narcotics Control Program (INCP) directly  supports the Foreign 
Assistance Act  (FAA) of 1961.  The FAA’s  key objectives are to suppress the illicit manufacturing 
and trafficking of narcotics and psychotropic drugs, money laundering, precursor chemical diversion, and to progressively eliminate the illicit cultivation of the crops from which narcotic and psychotropic drugs are derived.  While the FAA addresses statutory responsibilities for multiple agen cies, the DoD is specifically tasked as a key partner in the training of foreign allies 
on illegal narcotics interdiction and the prevention of illegal narcotics trafficking.  
 1.2 Purpose 
 
 This chapter provides pricing guidance for INCP transactions, expl ains special cost 
computation scenario s, and identifies procedures for the disposition of proceeds from collections.  
*It does not provide guidance and procedures on the DoD’s national drug and counterdrug activities as it focuses exclusively on the depart ment’s international training efforts  and partnership 
with the Department of State .    
 
1.3 Authoritative Guidance   The financial management policy and procedures addressed in this chapter are in 
accordance with Section 632 (c) of the FAA. 
 2.0 SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL PROGRAM  
 2.1 Billing  
  Section 632 (c) of the FAA  explains special pricing requirements when services, including 
training, are provided by the Department of Defense to the Department of State in support of the INCP.  Billing must be made within 30 calendar days after the month ly services are rendered.  The 
payment due date must be no more  than 30 days from the date of the invoice.  Bills rendered under 
this program are not subject to audit by the customer.    2.2 Pricing  
  The following rules must  be followed by DoD Components when determining amounts to 
be collected as reimbursements for orders from the Department of State that cite INCP financing.  
  
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 7  
* January 2024 
7-4  2.2.1.  INCP Training .  The tuition rate for DoD training provided to support INCP is an 
incremen tal rate comparable to the International Military Education and Training (IMET) rate.   
DoD FMR  Volume 15 provides a detailed explanation on tuition rates, direct and indirect costs of 
international student training, and IMET training price exceptions not c overed in this chapter.  The 
cost elements to include in the pricing are as follow s:  
 
  2.2.1.1.  Civilian Instructors and School Support Staff.  It is anticipated that 
additional cost s charged to the INCP for civilian instructors will be minimal for courses or 
groupings of courses when either the ratios of students to instructors or U.S. students to international students is high.  Courses must  be reviewed to determine the additional cost incurred 
resulting from international student attendance.   Classroom or technical courses that are similar, 
or that utilize instructors who teach more than one course, may be grouped for computation purposes.      2.2.1.1.1.  For groups of courses, an estimate must  be made of the number 
of U.S. students  in each course and the number of civilian instructors and civilian staff required.  
A second projection must  be made of the total number of students to be enrolled in applicable 
courses, both U.S. and international, and the number of civilian instructors and civilian staff 
required.  Base both projections on the maximum number of student output by civilian instructors or civilian staff rather than on optimum class size.   The difference in the number of civilian 
instructors and civilian staff between the tw o projections represents the additional civilian 
instructors and/or civilian staff required.  Applicable additional civilian instructors and civilian staff must  be priced in accordance with Volume 11A , Chapter 1.  This value, divided by the total 
number of  INCP students, represents the additional cost per INCP student for the course (or 
courses).  
    2.2.1.1.2.  When there is a one -for-one or one -for-two relationship of 
civilian instructors to students, the instructor in all cases is  considered additional.  If the entire 
class is composed of INCP students, the instructor, and staff must  be considered additional  in the 
pricing formula.  
   2.2.1.2.  Military Instructors and Military School Support Staff.  There must  be no 
charges to the INCP program for military personnel conducting training courses.  
   2.2.1.3.  Equipment Overhaul and Maintenance.  The overhaul and maintenance of 
major items of equipment, when computed on an hourly use basis, must  be considered  additional 
resources to a  course based on estimated utilization hours. 
   2.2.1.4.  Simulators .  Simulator hours must be  considered additional costs.   
Simulator costs must include pay of the operators, supplies and equipment maintenance.  Allocate 
simulator costs to the course using an equitable distribution across the  total hours available.  
   2.2.1.5.  Supplies, Materiel, Training Aids, Ammunition .  Charge the replacement 
costs of items not returned or reusable (including petroleum, oil, and lubricants) expended in the conduct of training as an additional cost.   
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 7  
* January 2024 
7-5   2.2.1.6.  Lost or Damaged Equipment.  If equipment was lost or damaged during 
training and it was found to be the result of an international student’s negligence, the additional 
cost to be charged must be  the actual costs of the repairs or rep lacement cost of the equipment.  
   2.2.1.7.  Base Support (That Is, Indirect Student Costs) .  A standard weekly rate 
must  be charged for INCP training conducted on DoD installations.  The fixed weekly amount 
must  be the same amou nt used for billing DoD appropriations reimbursed by the International 
Military Education and Training (IMET) program.  See Volume 15, Chapter 7, subparagraph 23.4.2, for additional details.  
   2.2.1.8.  Food Preparation.  Meal operating/food preparation costs are additive to 
other food costs.  The weekly meal operating and food preparation costs for INCP students must be the  same amount  used in billing DoD appropriations reimbursed by the  IMET program  when 
courses are co nducted on DoD installations and students use DoD appropriated dining facilities. 
   2.2.1.9.  Instructor Training .  Special courses provided on a non- routine basis to US 
instructors and personnel are considered additional costs and must be charged accordi ngly.  Charge 
the normal cost rate for all required training conducted at a U.S. training facility  in direct support 
of the INCP program (i.e., the Department of State ).  Treat special courses conducted by a 
Management Service Team (MST) away from the norm al training institution  as dedicated service , 
and charge the full cost billed to the INCP program.  
   2.2.1.10.  F acilities and Equipment .  The costs of any facilities or equipment 
acquired primarily for the support of international students enrolled in the INCP program are considered additional costs.  
   2.2.1.11.  Field Studies Program (FSP).  The full cost of the FSP to the U.S. 
Governme nt is considered an additional cost. 
   2.2.1.12.  Shipment of Retainable  Instructional Materials  (RIM) .  The shipment of 
RIM  to students must be included in the tuition rate applicable to INCP students.  Apply shipping 
charge s to the same DoD billing appropriations reimbursed by the  IMET program.   See 
Volume 15, Chapter 7, subparagraph s 22.10, 23.4.3.3, and 24.8.3 for additional details.  
   2.2.1.13.  Travel and Per Diem .  Instructor and student travel and per diem 
associated with the provision of training must be considered additional costs, to include 
transportation, living allowances, and medical expenses.  
  2.2.2.  Other DoD Services 
   2.2.2.1.  DoD Services Provided Incident to Normal Mission Accomplishment .  
When support of the INCP is accomplished incidental to performance of a DoD mission requirement, there are no additional costs incurred.  However, an extended mission  or overall cost 
increase constitutes the reimbursement of the cost over and above the scheduled mission cost .   
 
DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 7  
* January 2024 
7-6   2.2.2.2.  Scheduled DoD Transportation.  Air and ocean transportation services 
performed by the U.S. Transportation Command on scheduled movements must  be priced, where 
applicable, at current tariff rates for DoD Components.  
 
  2.2.2.3.  Detailed Personnel .  All costs incurred in connection with the detail of 
DoD personnel to the Department of State to support the INCP --both civilian and military --are 
considered additional expenses and must be priced at the normal rate charged to other Federal 
Agencies.  
  2.2.3.  Supplies and Equipment .  Sectio n 482 of the FAA prohibits the procurement of 
weapons or ammunition from funds authorized for this program.  Thus, any specific order for a weapon or ammunition that cites the appropriations provided to finance INCP either must be rejected or returned for a new fund citation.  Supplies and equipment that can be provided must be 
priced in accordance with Chapter 1.  Additionally, Chapter  1 establishes pricing policy for excess 
and non- excess material .   
 2.3 Disposition of Proceeds  
  Section 632(c) of the FAA  mandates that applicable collections from the Department of 
State must be reimbursed to the financing DoD appropriation account.

 CHAPTER 8  
 
INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITION AND CROSS -SERVICING AG REEMENTS  
 
*1.0 GENERAL  
 *1.1 Overview  
 
The Depar tment of Defense (DoD) strengthens key international partnerships through the 
acquisition and transfer of logistic support, supplies, and services (LSSS) between DoD and certain countries and regional organizations.  These acquisitions and transfers are  accomplished through 
Acquisition and Cross -Servicing  Agreements (ACSA) , on a  reimbursement basis, or by 
replacement -in-kind (RIK), or by exchange of supplies or services of an equal value  
(equal -value- exchange (EVE) ).  The use of these agreements streng thens alliances and provides  
beneficial s upport for  U.S. service members and respective members of foreign militaries  when 
U.S. supplies are not readily available.  
 *1.2 Purpose 
 This chapter provides guidance and instructions for pricing and disposition of proceeds for 
reimbursable  ACSA order s.  For management of ACSA  order s, this chapter acknowledges the 
ACSA Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS) as the DoD System of 
Record in accordance with Paragraph 5.k. of Enclosure A,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 2120.01.  
 *1.3 Authoritative Guidance  
  The financial management policy and related requirements addressed in this chapter are in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of the following sources, and apply to all A CSA and

2.0 GENERAL  POLICY  
 
*2.1 Liquidation of Credits and Liabilities  
 
Monetary reimbursement  occurs via a monetary instrument in  the currency of the supplying 
nation, as payment for LSSS.  The r ecipient  is responsible for the total cost of the order , to include  
additional fees imposed by financial institutions  for payment  processing .   Exchange/Replacement  
reimbursements , use RIK or EVE transfers  as the means of repayment  where e qual value is the 
actual, estimated, or negotiated price at the time of order  approval.  Signatures of the recipient and 
the supplier for the terms of the agreement are required and constitute approval.  
 
* 2.1.1.  Reim bursement  Order  Liquidation Method.  The reimbursement due date is 30 
days from the date of invoice, demand letter, or notice of payment due; unless a specific due date is established by statute, contract provision, or notice of indebtedness  Volume 16, Chapter 6, 
Paragraph 3.1.  The bill  is then distributed  by the Component or by th e Accounts Receivable Office 
(ARO) Volume 4, Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.4.  Bills must be accompanied by the completed F orm 
(usually, Form 1-3a generated in AGATRS ), or document containing a ll minimum essential data 
elements,  used to document the issue and receipt of supplies and services .  Payment  due date must 
not be more than 30 days from the date of the invoice, Chapter 1, Paragraph 2.3, unless terms of 
the ACSA agreement or Implementing Arrangement specify a different payment timeline.   A 
payment extension of  30 to 120 days from the due date is permissible , if initiated  by the recipie nt 
and based upon their process ing ca pabilities, with  mutual written agreement of all parties.  
 * 2.1.2.  Exch
 ange/Replacement  Order  Liquidation Method.  Exchange/Replacement  order s 
must be recorded and accrued  in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.   
Recorded Accounts Payables and Accounts Receivables related to the exchange of goods and services must be settled through the issue or receipt, as applicable, of the thing of equal value or replacement item, within 12 months of the original ( initial) order date of delivery, or within 90 
days of an agreed upon set tlement conference documented via the authorizing signatory certifying 
authority to the ACSA agreement.  If not settled within this period, the exchange/replacement order  
must convert to a mone tary reimbursable order and then be settled according to Volume 16,

authorization.  Requests must be accompanied by a justification, including a prioritization of 
requirements .  The requests must be submi tted to  the cognizant CCMD  through the requesting 
organization’s appropriate Component command. The authorizations do not increase the amount 
of obligational or apportioned anticipated reimbursable authority, but rather allow use of existing budget authori ty to enter into purchases or sales under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2347.  Requests 
must identify the categories of support as identified in figure B -1 in Appendix B.

 2.7 Distribution of Authorization Received  
  Upon receipt of an authorization from a CCMD , Component commands must authorize 
their activities to enter into reimbursable order s under  10 U.S.C. § 2342.  No activity or unit may  
enter into such order s without proper authorization. Recipients of an authorization must establish 
procedures to ensure that authorized dollar amounts are not exceeded.  *2.8 Ratific
ation  of Unauthorized ACSA Orders  
  2.8.1.  Ratification  is the confirmation or adoption of an unauthorized act after the fact.   
Ratification, as used in this subsection, means the act of approving an unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so.  An u nauthorized commitment, as used in this 
subsection, can be procedural or funding related, or a mix of both.  Procedural errors occur when 
the person who approved the ACSA order was not in possession of the required authority to approve the ACSA order.  Funding errors  occur when the funds required to cover the ACSA order 
are insufficient.  
  2.8.2.  FAR Part 1.602-3 provides a useful guide on how to carry out ratification properly 
and avoid an ADA violation under 31 U.S.C. § 1341 and Volume 14, Chapter 3.  The official with 
authority to ratify an ACSA order must work with the official’s corresponding legal office and Financial Manager(s) (to include those at Higher Headquarters) to determine if ratification is available and the best course of action.  If rat ification is deemed appropriate, the official authorized 
to ratify the ACSA order must use the process laid out by their component to answer the questions identified in this subparagraph and conduct an investigation to capture necessary documentation for adjudication/approval.  Figure A -1, (APPENDIX A) t he ACSA Ratification form, must be used 
to document and capture the questions.    2.8.2.1.  Determine  Why - The obligating party must document the reasons why the 
ACSA order was signed  and why such an obligation is inappropriate. 
   2.8.2.2.  Determine  U.S. Benefit  - Document the benefit(s) to the U.S. Government 
provided by ratification of the unauthorized commitments.  Include the bona fide U.S. Government requirement necessitating ratification .   
   2.8.2.3.  Remedial Corrective Actions - Describe all remedial corrective actions, 
disciplinary actions, or both that were taken; describe all action(s) taken to preclude recurrence.    
 
  2.8.2.4.  Determine  Measures for non -recurrence – Identify the measures 
undertaken to ensure that the obligating party and the foreign partner will not enter into such order s 
in the future.      2.8.2.5.  Determine Funding Availability - Determine that (1) proper funding was 
available at the time the obligation was incurred and (2) proper funding remains available at the time of ratification.

   2.8.2.6.  Adjudication Approval Determination – Investigate and conduct 
resolution at the lowest level possible.  If unable to resolve, elevate and work in conjunction with 
the Commander, Director, and Comptroller/Budget Officer in preparation for Gener al Officer or 
SES assessment  and requirement for Legal  review.  If unable to resolve , elevate to higher 
headquarters.  For order s greater than $1 million , forward findings through command channels to 
Joint Staff (J4 and Comptroller) for adjudication and approval .   If disapproved, reverse the ACSA 
order under the unauthorized transfer  and return the LSSS  to the original owning party or begin 
ADA violation in vestigation  and reporting .  (See Volume 14, Chapter 3, Section 2.0 for more 
information.)  
 
3.0 ACCOUNTING FOR  REIMBURSABLE LOGISTIC SUPPORT, SUPPLIES, AND 
SERVICES  
 3.1 Military  Department (Appropriation Holder) Procedures 
  The Assistant Secretary (Financial Management and Comptroller) of a Military Service 
will record specifically apportioned reimbursable program authority at the appropriation level as specified in the apportionment document received from the OMB .  Specifically, apportioned 
reimbursements are amounts earned and collected for property s old or services furnished under  
10 U.S.C. § 2346.  Within the Department, a reimbursement program must be authorized for the 
account by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) , Program and Financial Control 
Directorate (P&FC)  through the budget preparation process  and included in the budget submission 
materials to Congress .  Procedures for recording the authorization and tracking its use are 
contained in Volume 3, Chapters 13, 14 and 15.  T he allocation document forwarded to a CCMD  
will clearly differentiate between direct program authority and specifi cally apportioned 
reimbursable authority included in the funding document.  3.2 Unif
ied Command (Allocation Holder) Accounting Procedures 
  Unified commands will ensure that controls are in place to track amounts of specifically 
apportioned reimbursable authority included in the funding documents (allotments) issued to installation commands and operating units.   3.3 Installation Command/Operating Unit (Allotment Holder) Procedures  
  Installation commands and operating units will record the receipt of an allotment 
containing specifically apportioned reimbursable authority , for which reimbursable orders must be 
placed , before the authority may be used.  Procedures for recording the authorization and tracking 
its use are contained in Volume 3, Chapter 15.  A n allotment of anticipated reimbursable  authority 
does not provide obligational authority .  An allotment of anticipated reimbursable  program 
authority provides  the authority to accept reimbursable orders .  The accepted reimbursable order 
provides the obligational authority .  In the case of country -to-country agreements, reimbursable 
orders are those documents or forms specified in the agreement or amendments thereto.

 and finance support , must capture or obtain data on the use of this authority  and must provide for 
the appropriate targets or limitations within the affected allotments .  Similarly, receipt of the 
earned reimbursement authority requires the establishment of a customer order subsystem to 
capture data on the use of such authority .  Source documents pertaining to the authorized dollar 
amount and its use, such as obligations (DoD undelivered orders for materiel or services and accrued expenditures based on receipt of the materiel or services ordered), disbursements (liquidation of unpaid accrued expenditures), accounts payable (the unpaid portion of accrued 
expenditures), accounts receivable (earned reimbursements), and collections (receipt of payment to liquidate accounts receivable) must be recorded promptly in the financial  records .  Accounting 
for reimbursable orders under these authorizations must be maintained within the appropriate 
accounting records to assure crediting of remittances in accordance with paragraphs 2.3, 5.1, and 
sections 6.0 and 7.0.  *5.4 Exchange Order s and History Files  
  Control over exchange order s must be established and maintained through use of an 
exchange order history file .  Input to the history file must be made by submission of each individual 
order form which must include the minimum information prescribed in paragraph 6.2. AGATRS 
will be us ed to fulfill this purpose, ensuring compliance with DoDD 2010.09. 
 6.0 PRICING REIMBURSABLE ORDER S 
  10 U.S.C. Chapter 138, Subchapter I, authorizes  two methods for pricing reimbursable 
order s.  The method used is dependent upon the ability of the SECDEF to negotiate for the adoption 
of specific pricing principles for reciprocal application Pricing procedures under each of the alternatives are set forth  in paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2.  Additional pricing information is found in  
Chapter 1  and Volume 15, Chapter 7, Paragraph 3.1. 
 6.1 Reciprocal Pricing Principles   
  When a reciprocal pricing agreement is  negotiated  between the U.S.  and another  authorized 
party , pricing by the supplying country must be in accordance with the following: 
  6.1.1.  For new procurements, the price charged to a recipient country by the supplying country must be no less favorable than that charged the armed forces of the supplying country by 
its contractors .  The price charged must allow for differentials due to delivery schedules, points of 
delivery, and other similar considerations. 
 
 6.1.2.  For supplies from inventories of the supplying country, or for logistics support and government services, the supplying country must charge the recipient country the same prices as 
it charges its own armed forces for identical supplies or services .  When the DoD is the supplier, 
the price charged must be identical to rates charged by the DoD Components for cross -service 
logistics support or services .  Guidance on pricing such support or services is in Chapter 1 .  The 
DoD price to be charged is the price for type of sale "To Another DoD Component" as indicated in Chapter 1  and Chapter 4.  Where a price for a particular product or service is not otherwise 
specified, agreement on a price should be reached  prior to  execution.   Failing that, a “ not to exceed 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation Volume 11A, Chapter 08  
* July 2022  
8 -  17 
 amount,” establishing the upper limits of the financial liability of the receiving party, must be 
established . 
 
6.2 Nonreciprocal Pricing Principles  
  To the extent that a DoD Component cannot achieve mutual acceptance by another country 
of reciprocal pricing principles, or in the case of a NATO subsidiary body, the following procedures must apply:   6.2.1.  U.S.  commanders delegated authority to negotiate, approve, or execute  order s 
pursuant to DoD Directive 2010.09 must determine that the price for acquiring supplies or services 
is fair and reasonable.  This determination must be supported by a price analysis based on prior 
experience and supporting data , and consider ation  of all applicable circumstances .  If this 
determination  cannot be made, no purchases or sales  must take place.  
 
 6.2.2.  Any transfer of supplies or services by United States  Forces must be subject to the 
pricing provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 2344.  7.0 DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS  
  Any payment for materiel or services provided by United States forces and initially 
recorded as a sale order, must be credited to the appropriation or fund used in incurring the 
obligation .  Payment for a n order initially recorded as an exchange of materiel or serv ices, but 
converted into a sale due to non- receipt of replacement materiel or services, must be credited to 
the appropriation or fund currently available for the same purposes for which the expenditures for materiel or services exchanged were made.  
 *8.0 DEBT COLLECTION ACTIONS

forms: (1) through a financial contribution to the budget of the international organization, or (2) by assignment of U.S. m ilitary elements to the international organization under the terms of 
international treaties or agreements (see DoDI 5530.03).  The U.S. m ilitary elements may be 
assigned either on a long or short- term basis.  
  2.5.1.   Short-term assignments are typically for the purpose of participating in joint exercise s

international organization.  
  2.5.3.   Support under subparagraphs 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 are not reimbursable to DoD.  An 
exception to this policy is the  support by members of a U.S. m ilitary element who provide services

 CHAPTER 12  
 
MAJOR RANGE AND TEST FACILIT Y BASE  
 
1.0 GENERAL  (1201) 
 
*1.1 Overview  (120101) 
  The Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a national asset which is sized, 
operated, and maintained primarily for Department of Defense ( DoD)  test and evaluation support 
missions, but also is available to non- DoD users having a valid requirement for its capa bilities.   
The MRTFB is operated and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation support missions under the oversight of the D irector,  Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  The MRTFB  is 
managed and operated to provide test and evaluation support to the DoD Components responsible for developing or operating weapons systems.  They  are also available to Federal, state, local , and 
allied foreign governments as well as commercial users when a  valid requirement for range 
capabilities exists.  MRTFB missions vary from testing missiles and aircraft to ensuring that electrical components can survive in various environments.  The MRTFB is designed to assure the most cost -effective development and testing of materiel, and provide for inter -Service 
compatibility, efficiency, and equity without influencing technical testing decisions or inhibiting legitimate and valid testing . 
 1.2 Purpose (120102) 
  This chapter provides reimbursable policy for DoD MRTFB.  This chapter does not apply to the commercial space launch activities of the 30th and 45th Space Wings contained in Chapter  13.  Additionally, this chapter does not apply to the sale of samples, drawings, 
information, equipment, and certain services contained in Chapter 14.  
 *1.3 Authoritative Guidance (120103)   1.3.1.  DoD Directive  (DoDD) , Number 3200.11

 4.0 POLICY  (1204)  
 
*4.1 General  (120401) 
  The MRTFB must be managed and operated under uniform financial guidelines across the 
DoD Components.  Accordingly, all direct and indirect costs charged to MRTFB users  must be 
uniform and applied consistently among all the MRTFB activities.  DoD Components  must work 
with the Director, TRMC to ensure financial uniformity and consistency.  All costs incurred by MRTFB activities must be billed to one of the following sources: (1) MRTFB users  (customers ), 
(2) direct appropriations of the managing activity, or (3) other sources as directed by DoD.  *4.2 MRTFB Users (Customers ) (120402)  
  A MRTFB may be used by DoD Component users (including DoD training users) and 
Non-DoD Component users.  The type of user or customer determines the total amount charged to 
the user  and whether they are charged only direct costs or direct costs plus an appropriate level of 
indirect costs.  
 *4.3 Accounting (120403)   4.3.1.  Cost information is an important basis in setting user fees and reimbursements.  
Each MRTFB activity must accumulate and report  as required , the costs  
of its activities for management and audit purposes.  In accordance with  the  
Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 4
: “Managerial Cost Accounting 
Standards & Concepts ”, costs m ust be accumulated through the use of cost accounting systems.  
Such systems or techniques must be able to accurately capture full  costs (i.e., direct costs  or costs 
directly attribute d to a specific user ; and indirect costs  or costs that cannot be directly a ttributed to 
a specific user ) and more importantly, be used to determine accurate user charges or standard rates 
under agreements entered into pursuant to Chapter 1 and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4000.19 , 
“Support Agreements”.  Additionally, appropriate separation of duties and levels of authorization must be implemented into the cost -tracking process  to protect vulnerable areas such as controls 
over automatic user  billing and rate validation .  All rates must be applicable to the specific product 
or service provided.  E ach MRTFB activity must validate standard rates at least annually and adjust 
them accordingly to reflect unanticipated changes in costs or market values. 
  4.3.2.  In accordance with DoDD 3200.11, MRTFB  activities are categorized as Army, 
Navy, Air Force, or DoD CIO .  Specificall y, MRTFB activities are comprised of multiple assets, 
each of which is  reported individually on i ts respective consolidated Balance Sheet under General 
Property, Plant, and Equipment and further disclosed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

 *4.4 Reimbursements for MRTFB Activity Usage  (120404)  
 
 In accordance with DoDI 4000.19, MRTFB  activities  and DoD or Non- DoD Federal 
Component users must use support agreements (memorandums of agreement or understanding) to document and establish the General Terms and Conditions (GT&Cs) between buyers and sellers for all inter - and intra-governmental reimbursable transactions.  Additionally, in accordance with 
Volume 1, Chapter 4, buyers and sellers must ensure the Standard Line of Accounting is adhered to and properly annotated when generating or accepting a reimbursable order (i.e., Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request).  Moreover, reimbursement of direct costs incurred f or 
aborted or canceled tests or for damages to property or equipment caused by a user in the 
preparation for, or conduct of, any activity on the facility or range must be pursued to the extent permitted by law and DoD policy.  NOTE: For support agreements established during and or after Fiscal Year (FY) 201 7 and whose 
terms extend beyond FY 2017, MRTFB  activities  and DoD or Non- DoD Federal Component users 
are required to  upload and store their agreements on the Department of the Treasury’s G -Invoicing 
(formerly Invoice Processing Platform).  
 4.4.1.  Working Capital Fund Activities.  If an organization finances a MRTFB activity 
using WCFs, then its operations will be funded through reimbursable inter -governmental orders 
and user fees collected from non- Federal users .  Under the stabilized price standardized cost 
recovery method, managers of WCF activities within each Component must set rates/prices based on full cost recovery and must charge users in accordance with established pricing policies contained in Volume 2B, Chapter 9 and Volume 11B. 
 
 4.4.2.  Non -Working Capital Fund Activities .  If an organizati on does not finance a 
MRTFB using WCFs, then its operations will be funded through direct appropriations, reimbursable inter -governmental orders, and /or user fees collected from non- Federal users . 
 
  4.4.2.1.  DoD Component Users 
 
   4.4.2.1.1.  Direct Costs .  DoD Component users are to be charged and must  
reimburse MRTFB activities for direct costs identifiable with a particular program or customer 
order.  Direct costs billed must  be in accordance with Chapter s 1 and 4 and must  be attributed  to a 
job or function served in support of a customer order. 
     4.4.2.1.1.1.  By mutual agreement, investments in new or existing test and evaluation facilities may be funded, in whole or in part, by one or more DoD users  of a 
MRTFB activity.  This agreement , however, must explicitly  delineate responsibilities for 
ownership/capitalization  of the asset , funding, staffing, operating, and maintaining the facility, and 
must be approved by all parties prior to obligation of any funds for the project.      4.4.2.1.1.2.  Investments made under subparagraph 4.4.2.1.1 that 
change the composition of the MRTFB must conform to DoDI 3200.18.

*July 2016  
12-9 
     4.4.2.1.1.3.  Direct incremental costs (i.e., costs resulting from an 
increase in production) must be charged to DoD Component users . 
 
   4.4.2.1.2.  Indirect Costs .  DoD Component users are not to be charged and 
must not reimburse MRTFB activities  for indirect costs. 
     4.4.2.1.2.1.  O verhead (indirect) costs must not be charged to DoD 
Component users, and must remain as costs fully borne by the MRTFB activity and paid for by 
the institutionally funded program element accounts comprising the MRTF B’s budgetary 
structure.  
     4.4.2.1.2.2.  I ndirect incremental cost s must not be charged to DoD 
Components.  
*   4.4.2.1.3.  Military Personnel Costs .  As a rule, the applicable military 
personnel appropriations must fund the cost of direct (and indirect) military labor incurred in the performance of a service for, or the furnishing of materials to, another DoD Component user.  Therefore, since a direct appropriation is provided for that purpose, the cost of military labor must not be charged to another DoD Component user except for the cost of military personnel assigned to the WCF activities.  WCF activities must be reimbursed by their users  for the cost  of military 
labor as prescribed in Volume 11B, Chapter 12. 
   4.4.2.2.  Non -DoD Component Users. 
 
   4.4.2.2.1.  Direct Costs .  Non -DoD Component users are to be  charged and 
must reimburse MRTFB activities for  all direct costs readily identifiable with a particular program 
or customer order.  Military labor incurred by non- Working Capital Fund activities must be 
charged to non- DoD Component users on the basis of the actual hours worked or assigned .  
Military personnel costs must be comp uted or priced at the composite standard military pay rate s 
in accordance with Chapter 6, Appendix I.  
 
   4.4.2.2.2.  Indirect Costs.  MRTFB commanders may charge non- DoD 
Component users  an appropriate level  of indirect costs at their discretion.  Any indi rect costs 
incurred, but not billed to a user , must  be billed to the MRTFB  activity’ s institutional or 
appropriated funding.  Appropriated funding levels, however, must  not be increased to finance any 
additional indirect cost incurred due to sales to non- DoD activities.  
 
 4.4.3.  Foreign Military Sales.  Foreign Military Sales users  must reimburse MRTFB 
activities in accordance with Volume 15, Chapter 7.  This chapter does not, and must not, be 
construed to permit foreign customer countries or foreign commercial entities to purchase services from MRTFB activities through other than Foreign Military Sales procedures authorized under the Arms Export Control Act. 
 
 4.4.4.  Government- Furnished Services .  When the use of an MRTFB activity has been 
included in a contractual agreement as government -furnished services, the user must be charged 
based on the category of the contracting government agency (see subparagraphs  4.4.2.1 or 4.4.2.2).

12-10 
 *4.5 Disposition of Collections . (120405)  
 
 4.5.1.  Working Capital Fund Activities .  For a MRTFB activity financed using WCFs, 
reimbursable operations are funded through reimbursable inter -governmental orders and user fees 
collected from a non -Federal user .  Section 2208(h) of T itle 10, U.S.C., provides general authority 
for retention and use of amounts collected under both inter -governmental orders and user fees.  
Reimbursable inter -governmental orders are valid budgetary resources available to a MRTFB 
activity for obligation; however, a MFTRB activity financed using WCFs may not recognize user 
fees as a budgetary resource until collected from  a non- Federal user . 
 
 4.5.2.  Non -Working Capital Fund Activities .  For a MRTFB activity not financed using 
WCFs, its operations may be financed through direct appropriations , reimbursable inter -
governmental orders, and/or user fees collected from non -Federal users .  Inter -governmental 
orders under reimbursable statutory authorities such as the Economy Act increase available budgetary resources in the reimbursable program of the appropriation the Component uses to finance th e MRTFB.  To the extent a statutory miscellaneous receipts exception is applicable to a 
reimbursable transaction with a non- Federal user , user charges collected from such users  may be 
credited to the reimbursable program of the applicable direct appropriation.  Section 2681(d) of Title 10, U.S.C., provides such authority for certain transactions with commercial entities 
conducting test and evaluation activities at MTRFB  activitie s.

1.0 GENERAL  (1401) 
 
1.1 Overview  (140101) 
  The Department of Defense (DoD) promotes research and development within the 
commercial sector of the U.S. economy by transferring technology and information from the Department  to the commercial sector.  This policy strengthens both national and economic security 
by establishing a national technology and industrial base  to sustain military superiority and 
increase U.S. production capabilities .  The transfer of technology and information from the 
Department  to the commercial sector enables  critical research and leads to the development of  both 
useful military and/or commercial technology.  
 1.2 Purpose (140102)   This chapter prescribes financial management policy for reimburs ement  through sale or fee 
and, the disposition of fees and proceeds received by making testing facilities available; and 
resulting from the provision of samples, drawings, information, and equipment to any person or 
entity, as authorized.  Authorization is provided by Title 10, United States Code, section 2539b  
(10 U.S.C. § 2539b
), “Availability of samples, drawings, information, equipment, materials, and 
certain services”  and implemented in DoD Instruction ( DoDI)  5535.11 , “Availability of Samples, 
Drawings, Information, Equipment, Materials, and Certain Services to Non- DoD Persons and 
Entities .”  This chapter does not apply to facilities and ranges of the Major Range and Test Facility 
Base (MRTFB) (see Chapter 12 for reimbursable  policy applicable to DoD MRTFB s).

authorized by a law of the U .S. instead of acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or 
services for the direct benefit or use of the U .S. Government; and (2) substantial involvement is 
not expected between the executive agency and the state, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.

2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 14  
* June 2021 
14-11   4.3.1.1.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2539b, user fees may not exceed the 
amount necessary to recoup the direct and indirect costs incurred (i.e., total or full costs) by providing the service, facility, or equipment.  However, DoDI 5535.11 allows for the elimination 
of in direct costs  when approved by the director or commander, prior to providing the service or 
use of facilities and equipment;  
   4.3.1.2.  Costs may include capital improvement costs, utility costs, depreciation, contractor support, salaries of personnel, and all other ancillary support costs.  Reference  
DoDI  5535.11;  
   4.3.1.3.  Specific policy pertaining to the calculation (i.e., identification of specific costs) and reporting of fees for the provision of services, equipment, and facilities pursuant to subparagraphs 3.1.3 and 3.1.4, can be found in Chapter 4 under the authority of  
OMB  Circular  A-25. 
  4.3.2.  When approved by the laboratory directors, facility directors, and/or commander s, 
prior to providing the service or use of facilities and/or equipment, all or a portion of the indirect costs may be eliminated from the fee.  Fees charged for services at less than total costs are permitted only when there is a compelling reason or it is determined to be in the best interest of national defense to do so.    4.3.2.1.  S pecial consideration as to recovery of less than full costs may be given  
when:     4.3.2.1.1.  The recipient of the benefit is engaged in a nonprofit activity designed for public safety, health, or welfare;     4.3.2.1.2.  Payments of full fees by a s tate, local government, or nonprofit 
activity would not be in the Department ’s best interest; or  
    4.3.2.1.3.  The laboratory directors, facility directors, and/or commander s 
have determined that the administrative costs of determining and collecting the full fees would outweigh the benefits to the Component.    4.3.2.2.  When less than full cost is charged, laboratory directors, facility directors, and commander s must maintain adequate documentation justifying or supporting each decision.  
Such documentation must  address the criteria in subparagraphs 4.2.1 and 4 .2.2, and be available 
for audits or inspections and for review by higher authorities.   4.3.3.  DoD Working Capital Fund laboratories and facilities must use standard (stabilized) rates to establish fees in accordance with Volume 11B, and DoD Components  designated as 
MRTF Bs must determine costs and fees in accordance with Chapter 12.

TRAINING OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES  
WITH  FRIENDLY FOREIGN FORCES  
 
1.0 OVERVIEW  (1501) 
 
1.1 Purpose (150101)   This chapter provides accounting and reporting procedures to implement provisions of  
Title 10, United States Code, section 322 
 that are related to the  training of special operations forces 
with friendly foreign  forces.  
 1.2 Authority for Payment of Training Expenses (150102)   10 U.S.C . § 322, authorizes, the Commander, United States  Special Operations Command 
and the commander of any other unified or specified combatant command to pay, or authorize payment for, any of the following expenses:  
  1.2.1.   Expenses of overseas training of U.S. special operations forces, to include civil affairs 
forces and psychological operations forces, assigned to the combatant commander in conjunction 
with training, and training with, armed forces and other security forces of a friendly foreign country.   1.2.2.   Expenses of deploying such special operations forces, to include civil affairs forces 
and psychological operations  forces, for that training. 
  1.2.3.   Incremental expenses incurred, in the case of training in con junction with a friendly 
developing country, by that country as the direct result of such training.  The term, “incremental expenses,” with respect to a developing country, means the reasonable and proper costs of rations, fuel, training ammunition, transp ortation (except to and from the continental United States or from 
one country to another country), and other goods and services consumed by such country, except that the term does not include pay, allowances, and other normal costs of such country’s personnel.  
 1.3 Purpose of Training (150103)   For the authority cited in paragraph 1.2 to apply, the primary purpose of the overseas training 
activities must be the training of  special operations forces of the combatant commands .  Training of 
foreign for ces may not be the primary purpose.

* July 2019  
15-4 2.0 POLICY AND PROCEDURES  (1502) 
 
2.1 Accounting Procedures (150201)   Departmental funds expended to facilitate the participation of friendly foreign  forces training 
with U.S. special operations forces must  be incurred an d reported under the following guidelines : 
  2.1.1.   Funding for training of U.S. personnel may include amounts for training expenses 
authorized in 10 U.S.C. § 322.  The funding source for these proposed payments must  be funds made 
available to the applicable DoD Component for these purposes.  
  2.1.2.   Prior to commencement of the training, agreement on implementing arrangements 
should be reached in terms of th e types and scope of non- financial support and financial contributions 
to be provided by the United States to a foreign  country and/or by a foreign country to the United 
States.  In order to protect the interests of the United States, the essential terms o f the arrangement 
should normally be documented in writing and a copy of the document provided to the foreign  
country.  In addition, the arrangement should request that each participating country identify both physical and financial contributions to the training effort and the amount of expenses paid related thereto.  Formal foreign agreements, under the provisions of DoD Instruction  5530.03
, 
"International Agreements,"  are not required with respect to these implementing arrangements.  
  2.1.3.   In the event that the particip ating country is unable to identify its expenses in time to 
meet reporting requirements, knowledgeable U.S. personnel will estimate that participant’s contributions, and the value of expenses paid in U.S. dollar equivalents at the exchange rate in effect at the time of the training.  Estimates of a participating country’s contributions may be calculated 
using relative factors of comparable costs for similar U.S. training activities.  
  2.1.4.   Arrangements with a friendly developing country may provide for f inancial or in -kind 
payment to the developing country by the United States  for incremental expenses incurred by that 
country as a direct result of such training.  “Incremental expenses” are defined in subpa ragraph  1.2.3.  
  2.1.5.   Arrangements with a friendly country also may provide for payment to that country 
by the United States  for the costs of support provided to U.S. personnel by the host country.  
Expenses that may be paid under the terms of an arrangement with a friendly country for support provide d to U.S. personnel by that country are limited to those types of expenses included in the 
definition of incremental expenses described in subparagraph 1. 2.3. 
  2.1.6.   For expenses that are to be paid to a friendly country, either incremental costs incurr ed 
by a developing country or support provided by a host country to U.S. personnel, the arrangement must  stipulate that the host country provides, in advance of payment, appropriate documentation to 
support the payment.  This documentation must  include dates, quantities, units and costs so that the 
senior U.S. official can determine the reasonableness and propriety of such costs, in U.S. dollar equivalents at current exchange rates, for the various types of authorized expenses incurred.  
  2.1.7.   The following procedures must  be followed to substantiate payments for reasonable 
incremental expenses incurred by a developing country.  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 15  
* July 2019  
15-5   2.1.7.1.   The senior foreign  official participating in the training must  certify that the 
documentation provided to support the claim for payment reflects reasonable and proper expenses 
incurred during the training.  
   2.1.7.2.   The senior U.S. official participating in the training must  include a statement 
that, in his or her judgment, the documentation reflects reasonable and proper expenses.  
   2.1.7.3.   If the senior U.S. official participating in the training questions the propriety 
or reasonableness of any expense claimed by the foreign country, resolution of those questions must  
occur before the payment is made.  
  2.1.8.  The following procedures must  be followed to substantiate payments for reasonable 
expenses to support U.S. personnel.  
   2.1.8.1.   The U.S. official accepting the goods and/or services on behalf of the United 
States Government must  certify receipt and acceptance for the United States Government.  The 
acceptance must  include documentation of the dates, quantities, units, and costs of the various types 
of support received.  
   2.1.8.2.   The host country must  submit a claim for payment that includes 
documentation of the dates, quantities, units, and costs, in U.S. dollar equivalents at current exchange 
rates, of the various types of support provided.  
  2.1.9.   The annual report (described in paragraph 2.2) requires a determination of both 
financial and n on-financial contributions to the training effort and the amount of related expenses 
paid by the participants in such training.  Financial and non- financial contributions include all costs 
that are incurred because of the training.  The accounting records from which the contributions are reported must  include the separate identification of all the costs incurred, such as:  
   2.1.9.1.   Rations, fuel, and training ammunition.  
   2.1.9.2.   Personnel (including lodging, and/or per diem costs) for other than nor mal 
pay and allowances.  
   2.1.9.3.   Costs associated with training areas, firing ranges, storage sites, and other

 CHAPTER 17  
 
OFFSETTING RECEIPTS  
 
1.0 OVERVIEW  (1701) 
 *1.1 GENERAL  (170101) 
  This chapter  prescribes standard procedures for accounting and reporting offsetting receipts 
throughout the Department of Defense (DoD).  
 *2.0 DEFINITIONS  (1702) 
 2.1 Offsetti ng Receipts  (170201)  
  Offsetting receipts are collections within the Department of Defense that result from 
proprietary or business like transactions (such as rents, sales of services and products, patent fees, sale of property, etc.) and from Intragovernmental transactions such as deposits between Federal and trust funds or payments within the same fund group.    2.1.1.   Offsetting  receipts are recorded as offsets to gross outlays and may be distributed or 
undistributed.  Distributed offsetting receipts offset outlays of DoD as the agency that conducts the activity generating the receipts.  Undistributed offsetting receipts offset g overnment wide outlays.  
  2.1.2.   Offsetting receipts  are credited to general fund, special fund, or trust fund receipt 
accounts and offset gross outlays .  Standard receipt accounts are prescribed by the Department of 
the Treasury in its Federal Account Symbols and Titles (FAST) Book
.  Offsetting receipts are 
deposited with the Department of the Treasury Financial Management Service (FMS) using receipt accounts symbols and reported monthly on the FMS Form 1220, “ Statement of Transactions 
According to Appropriations, Funds and Receipt Accounts” as prescribed in Volume 6A Chapter  3. 
  2.1.3.   Offsetting receipts are deducted from budget authority and outlays at agency 
(Component) levels.  Actual offsetting receipts are reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources and in budget submissions by DoD Components as described in Volume 6B Chapter 7. 
  2.1.4.   Receipts collected by DoD Components shall be classified according to  
(1) the source of the receipt, (2) the authority for the collection and the nature of the transaction, and (3) whether the receipt offsets agency (Component) or government -wide totals.  Receipts also are 
classified into fund groups in accordance with the Treasury FAST Book  (i.e., general funds (0000-
3799); clearing accounts (3800- 3899); special funds (5000- 5999); and trust funds (8000 -8999 )).  In 
this section of the FAST Book, distributed offsetting receipts, as described in the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB) Circular No. A -136
 “Financial Reporting Requir ements” are 
identified with the check √ symbol before the account title. 
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 17  
* July 2012  
17-4 
 * 2.1.5.   Most offsetting receipts are offset (deducted) against the function that contains the 
outlays which give rise to the receipts, i.e., the function of the account collecting the money.  In such 
cases, these offsetting receipts are deducted at the agency and sub -functional level before reaching 
functional budget authority or outlay totals, and are referred to as “distributed”  to the functions.  
However, there are several categ ories of offsetting receipts that cannot be offset properly against any 
specific function.  These collections are deducted at  government -wide totals and are referred to as 
“undistributed offsetting receipts.”  Such receipts are either intrabudgetary (a payment from one 
Federal agency to another, such as agency payments to the retirement trust funds) or proprietary (a payment from the public for some type of business transaction with the government).  There are 
four (4) types of receipts that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts:  
   2.1.5.1.   Agency payments (including payments by off -budget Federal entities) as 
employers into employees’ retirement funds;    2.1.5.2.   Interest recei ved by trust funds;  
   2.1.5.3.   Rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and  
   2.1.5.4.   Other interest such as that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in 
deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget.

 *3.2 Budgeting Standards ( 170302) 
 
 Budgeting standards for offsetting receipts are prescribed by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A -11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget.  
 
 
 Preparation of budget justification requirements are also prescribed in Volume 2B Chapter 11, 
“Budget Formulation and Presentation.”  OMB adopted a single format to present like information 
in the SF 132, SF -133, and Schedule P.  The realignment employs three common data sections —
Budgetary Resources; Change in Obligated Balance; and Budget Authority and Outlays, Net. The SF-133, Schedule  P and Statement of Budgetary Resources will use all three of the sections, and 
the SF 132 will use the common Budgetary Resources.  *4.0 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR OFFSETTING RECEIPTS  
(1704)  *4.1 Offsetting Receipts  (170401) 
  Offsetting receipts within the Department are collections from the public that result from 
business -like transactions such as sales of property, rental fees or sales of services.  These 
miscellaneous proprietary receipts are recorded us ing receipt account symbols prescribed by the 
Treasury FAST Book .  Offsetting receipt account symbols normally used within the Department are:  Budget Classification of Offsetting Receipts

Funds in the budget.  *5.3 Accuracy and Timeliness  (170503) 
  The accuracy and timeliness of recording and reporting offsetting receipts are critical in 
the budget preparation process.  Actual receipts for the prior year are reported in the budget submissions and are used as the basis for projecting estimates for the budget outyears.

18-5 *2.0 DEFINITIONS  (1802)  
 
2.1 Assisted Acquisition  (180201)  
  FAR Subpart 2.1
 defines an assisted acquisition as a type of interagency acquisition where 
a servicing agency performs acquisition activities on a requesting agency’s behalf, such as 
awarding and administering a contract, task order, or delivery order.  DFARS 217.701 defines 
assisted acquisition similarly as the type of interagency contracting through which acquisition officials of a non- DoD agency award a con tract, task, or delivery order for the acquisition of 
supplies or services on behalf of DoD. 
 2.2 Direct Acquisition  (180202)  
  Per FAR Subpart 2.1, a direct acquisition is a type of interagency acquisition where a 
requesting agency places an order directly against a servicing agency’s indefinite -delivery 
contract.  The servicing agency manages the indefinite- delivery contract but does not participate 
in the placement or administration of an order.  DFARS 217.701 defines direct acquisition as a type of interagency contracting through which DoD orders a supply or service from a Government-wide acquisition contract maintained by a non- DoD agency.  
 2.3 Interagency Acquisition (180203)  
  As defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, an interagency acquisition is an action by w hich an agency 
needing supplies or services (the requesting agency) obtains them from another agency (the servicing agency) by an assisted acquisition or a direct acquisition.  The term includes 
acquisitions under the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. § 1535) and non- Economy Act acquisitions 
completed under other statutory authorities.  2.4 Multiple Year Appropriation  (180204)  
  As used in this chapter, a multiple year appropriation means an appropriation that is 
available for obligation for a definite period of time in excess of one fiscal year.  2.5 Non-Severable Service (180205)  
  A non- severable service represents a single und ertaking that cannot be feasibly subdivided.  
If the service produces a single or unified outcome, product, or report, the service is considered non-severable.  
 2.6 Requesting Agency (180206)  
  The requesting agency is defined in FAR Subpart 2.1 as the agency that has the requirement 
for an interagency acquisition.   
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-6 2.7 Servicing Agency (180207)  
 
 The servicing agency is defined in FAR Subpart 2.1 as the agency that will conduct an 
assisted acquisition on behalf of the requesting agency.  2.8 Severable Service (180208)  
  A severable service represents a service that is continuing and recurring in nature where 
the agency realizes a benefit at the time that the service is provided even if the contract has not been performed to completion.  A s ervice is considered severable if it can be separated into a 
component that independently provides value to meet an agency’s need.  2.9 Trading Partner (180209)  
  A trading partner is defined as a Federal entity that is party to intragovernmental 
transactions  with another Federal entity.  This includes transactions between DoD Components 
and transactions between DoD Components and other non- DoD Federal entities.  
 3.0 LEGAL AUTHORITY (1803) 
 3.1 Statutory Conditions on Use (180301)   Specific statutory a uthority is required to place a non- Economy Act  order with a non- DoD 
agency for goods or services, and to pay the associated cost.  If specific statutory authority does not exist, the default will be the Economy Act which is discussed in Chapter 3.  The more commonly used non-Economy Act authorities include, but are not limited to:  
 3.1.1.  Acquisition Services Fund.  The Acquisition Service s Fund was established by the 
General Services Administration Modernization Act  that merged the General Supply Fund and 
the Information Technology Fund to carry out functions related to the uses of the Acquisition  Services Fund including any functions previously carried out by the 
Federal  Supply Service and the Federal Technology Service managed by the 
General  Service Administration  (GSA) . 
 
 3.1.2.  Franchise Funds .  Franchise Funds were first established by the 
Government  Management Reform Act of 1994  to provide common administrative support 
services on a competitive and fee basis.  
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-7 3.2 Justification  (180302) 
 
 Non-Economy Act orders may be placed with a non- DoD Federal  agency for goods or 
services if:  
  3.2.1.  Proper funds are available;   3.2.2.  The order does not conflict with another agency’s designated responsibilities (e.g., real property lease agreements with GSA);  
  3.2.3.  The requesting agency or unit determines the order is in the best interest of DoD; and 
  3.2.4.  The performing agency is able and authorized to provide the ordered goods or services.  
 3.3 Simplified Acquisition Threshold  (180303) 
  Non-Economy Act orders greater than  the simplified acquisition threshold must comply 
with FAR Part 7  and established  DoD Components’  procedures for the p roper use of non- DoD 
contracts.  The  “Non -Economy Act Acquisition Package Checklist” provided in Figure 18-1 and 
the list of “Requesting Official Responsibilities” in  Figure 18- 2 will assist in ensuring that statute, 
policy, and regulation are complied with under non -Economy Act orders. 
 3.4 Prohibitions (180304)   Non-Economy Act orders may not be used to : 
  3.4.1.  V iolate provisions of law  or accomplish what regulations do not permit under 
commercial contracts; or  
  3.4.2.  C ircumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of funds to include 
extending the period of availability of the cited funds.  4.0 INITIATING A NON- ECONOMY ACT ORDER  (1804) 
 4.1 Order ing Procedures and Requirements (180401) 
  FAR Subpart 7.5, FAR Subpart 7.7, DFARS Subpart 217.5, and DFARS Subpart 217.7 
address the procedures that apply to all interagency acquisitions .  A non- Economy Act order must  
comply with the documentation standards in Chapter 1  and supported with the items identified in 
Figure 18- 1.  Non-Economy Act orders must include: 
  4.1.1.  A firm, clear, specific, and complete description of the goods or services ordered.  The use of generic descriptions is not acceptable;  
 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-8  4.1.2.  Speci fic performance or delivery requirements; 
 
 4.1.3.  A proper fund citation;   4.1.4.  Payment terms and conditions ( e.g., direct cite or reimbursement, and specific 
appropriation or law authorizing advanced payments);   4.1.5.  A specific non -Economy Act statutory authority citation such as those referenced in 
paragraph 3.1;   4.1.6.  The following statement on funding documents for severable services:  “These funds are available for severable service requirements crossing fiscal years for a period not to exceed one year, where the period of any resultant contract for services commences this fiscal 
year.  All funds not placed on contract this fiscal year must be returned promptly to the ordering 
activity, but no later than one year after the acceptance of the order or upon completion of the order, whichever  is earlier.”;  
  4.1.7.  The following statement on funding documents for goods or non -severable services:  
“I certify that the goods or non- severable services to be acquired under this agreement are 
necessary expense of the appropriation charged, and represent a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which these funds are obligated.” ; and  
  4.1.8.  DoD Activity Address Code (DODAAC)  
 *4.2 Treasury Guidance  (180402) 
  4.2.1.  The TFM Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 4700, Section 4706, 
“Intragovernmental Quarterly and Year -End Requirements,” discusses the requirements necessary 
to properly report intragovernmental transactions resulting from business activities (i.e., buy/sell transactions) between two Federal  government entities, called trading partners.  It 
further references the Intragovernmental Transaction Guide (Appendix 6) as containing the business rules and processes to properly record, report, and reconcile intragovernmental transactions, including the processes for dispute resolution.   4.2.2.  The guidance in TFM, Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 4700, Appendix 6, Section 9 provides the standard Interagency Agreement
 contain ing two Fiscal Service (FS) Forms: 
FS Form 7600A , General Terms and Conditions (GT&C) and FS  Form 7600B , Order Form.   
Treasury has mandated the use of these two forms to ensure the proper recording and reporting on intragovernmental buy/sell transactions, and to e liminate the F ederal -wide reporting deficiencies 
impacting the Financial Report of the U.S. Government.  Accordingly, all DoD Components must use the latest published versions of FS Forms 7600A/B when completing a non- Economy Act 
order and these mus t comply with the Federal Intrag overnmenta l Data Standards when using the  
Treasury's G -Invoicing  system, DoD Ordering systems, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
systems , or when completing the FS Forms 7600 A/B manually.  Until DoD  Ordering Systems and  
ERP systems are capable of processing the FS Form 7600B, DoD trading partners should continue  
  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-9 to accept the current order forms (e.g., DoD ( DD) Form 448, Military In terdepartmental Purchase 
Request).   Individual orders must be placed against an FS Form 7600A. 
 
 4.2.3.  The Treasury's G -Invoicing system must be used to negotiate, broker, and 
electronically store the GT&Cs and associated transactions between buyers and sellers for all inter- and i ntragovernmental reimbursable transactions as appropriate system capabilities come 
online for individual DoD Components.  This requirement is for all i nteragency agreement s with 
a performance period extending to June 30, 2021 or later.  In instances where G -Invoicing is not 
available, such as remote deployments or other austere conditions, DoD Components must use hardcopies of FS  Forms  7600A/B.  DoD Components must establish internal policies and 
procedures for designating signature authority for GT&Cs.   4.2.4.  The requesting scope of work on the FS Form 7600A should cover relatively broad categories of goods or services when feasible.  When the system s capability become available to 
accept the FS Form 7600B within DoD Ordering Systems or ERPs, the FS Form 7600B  must 
discretely define the goods or services for each order.  When practical and legally permissible, the 
agreement period on the FS Form 7600A should cover multiple years.  4.3 Best Interest Determination  (180403) 
  Each requirement must be evaluated in accordance with DoD Components’ procedures to 
ensure that non-Economy Act orders are in the best interest of DoD.  Factors to consider include:   4.3.1.  Satisfying customer requirements;   4.3.2.  Schedule, performance, and delivery requirements;   4.3.3.  Cost effectiveness, taking into account the discounts and fees; and   4.3.4.  Contract administration, to include oversight.  5.0 FISCAL POLICY  (1805) 
 5.1 Specific, Definite and Certain  (180501) 
  For non -Economy Act orders greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, the 
requesting official must provide:   5.1.1.  Evidence of market res earch and acquisition planning; 
  5.1.2.  A statement of work that is specific, definite, and certain both as to the work 
encompassed by the order and the terms of the order itself; and  
  5.1.3.  Unique terms, conditions, and requirements to comply with applicable DoD -unique 
statues, regulations, directives, and other requirements.  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-10 5.2 Contracting Officer Review  (180502) 
 
 All non- Economy Act orders greater than $500,000 must be reviewed by a DoD warranted 
Contracting Officer prior to sending the order to the funds certifier or issuing the 
FS Forms  7600A/B to the non- DoD activity.  In addition to the review by the C ontracting Officer, 
the requesting official must further review the acquisition package to ensure compliance with the 
FAR Part 7, and the DoD Component’s procedures.  5.3 Certification of Funds (180503)   Non-Economy Act orders are subject  to the same fiscal limitations that are contained within 
the appropriation from which they are funded.  Because the servicing entity may not be aware of 
all the appropriation limitations, the DoD requesting official must certify that the funds cited on 
the order are available, meet time limitations, and are for the purpose designated by the appropriation.  5.4 Bona Fide Need  (180504) 
  The bona -fide needs rule  (31 U.S.C. § 1502)  provides that an appropriation or fund limited 
for obligation to a definite period is available only for payment of expenses properly incurred during the period of availability or to complete contracts properly made within that period of availability.  Non -Economy Act reimbursable orders of DoD Components for supplies, material, 
services or equipment placed with non- DoD agencies are subject to policies that, in practical effect, 
make them subject to obligational standards used for Economy Act reimbursable orders.  Non-Economy Act orders citing an annual or multiple  year appropriation must serve a bona fide 
need arising, or existing, in the fiscal year( s) for which the appropriation is available for new 
obligations.  Otherwise, a valid obligation is not accomplished.  An interagency agreement  may 
not be used in the last days of the fiscal year solely to prevent funds from expiring or to keep them available for a requirement arising in the following fiscal year.  Bona fide need generally is a determination of the requesting agency  and not that of the servicing activity.  A servicing agency  
should, however, refuse to accept a non- Economy Act order if it is obvious that the order does not 
serve a need existing in the fiscal year for which the appropriation is available.  5.5 Obligation  (180505) 
  T he provisions of 31 U.S.C. § 1501
 govern the recording of the obligation.  An amount 
must  be recorded as an obligation only when supported by documentary evidence of an order 
required by law to be placed with an agency or upon meeting all the following criteria: 
  5.5.1.  Binding agreement (funding vehicle) between an agency and another person (including an agency);   5.5.2.  Agreement is in writing  using FS Form 7600A ; 
  5.5.3.  For a purpose authorized by law;  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-11  5.5.4.  Serves a bona fide need arising, or existing, in the fiscal year or years for which the 
appropriation is available for obligation;   5.5.5.  Executed before the end of the period of availability for new obligation of the appropriation or fund used; and   5.5.6.  Provides for specific goods to be delivered, real property to be bought or leased, or specific services to be supplied.  
 5.6 Deobligation (180506)   Funding under non -Economy Act orders must  be deobligated as outlined in this paragraph. 
 
 5.6.1.  Goods .  Funds provided to a performing agency for ordered goods where the funds 
period of availability thereafter has expired must  be deobligated and returned by the performing 
agency unless the request for goods was made during the period of availability of the funds and the item(s) could not be delivered within the funds period of availability because of delivery, production or manufacturing lead time, or unforeseen delays that are out of the control and not previously contemplated by the contracting parties a t the time of contracting.  
   5.6.1.1.  Where materials cannot be obtained in the same fiscal year in which they are needed and contracted for, provisions for delivery in the subsequent fiscal year do not violate the bona fide need rule as long as the time  intervening between contracting and delivery is not 
excessive and the procurement is not for standard commercial off the shelf items readily available from other so urces.  
   5.6.1.2.  The delivery of goods may not be specified to occur in the year subsequent to funds availability unless delivery meets the exceptions cited in subparagraph 5.6.1.1 and a 
justifiable bona fide need exists in the year funds are available for obligation.  
 5.6.2.  Severable Services .  An agreement for severable services that are continuing and 
recurring in nature and provide DoD a benefit each time the service is performed 
(e.g., maintenance and repair services, scientific, engineering, and technical services) is based on statutory authority other than the Economy Act.  The provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 2410(a)  permit the 
performance of severable services to begin in one fiscal year and end in the next provided the period of performance does not exceed one year.  A non- DoD Federal agency may rely on this 
authority to fill a DoD order funded with fiscal year appropriations to issue a contract for severable services that crosses fiscal years as long as the contract period commences during the period of availability of the DoD customer appropriation.  Obligating funds for placing a non- Economy act 
order with a non- DoD Federal agency, where the resultant fixed -length severable services contract 
awarded by the non- DoD Federal agency will exceed the one -year limit set forth in 
10 U.S.C. § 2410(a) , or which is not to commence until a subsequent fiscal year, may result in an 
Antideficiency violation under 
31 U.S.C. § 1341 . 
   5.6.2.1.  The performance of severable services must begin during funds period of availability and may not exceed one year. 
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-12   5.6.2.2.  Annual appropriations provided to a performing agency that have expired 
must  be deobligated unless the performance of the services requested began during the funds 
period of availability and the period of performance does not exceed one year.  
   5.6.2.3.  The annual appropriation from the earlier fiscal year may be used to fund the entire cost of the one-year period of performance; however, annual appropriations may not be used to enter into a severable services agreement where the period of performance for services requested is entirel y in the following fiscal year. 
   5.6.2.4.  In no instance may the period of performance extend beyond September  30 of the subsequent year for services funded with annual appropriations. 
 
 5.6.3.  Non -Severable Services .  Non- severable services contracts must be funded entirely 
with appropriations available for new obligations at the time the contract is awarded, and the period of performance may extend across fiscal years.   Funds provided to a performing agency that 
become excess must  be deobligated as identified. 
 
 5.6.4.  Excess or Expired Funds .  Activities must  reconcile all obligations and remaining 
funds available for orders.  The purpose of this reconciliation is to ensure the proper use of funds and to identify and coordinate the return of expired or excess funds.  Excess or expired funds must be returned by the performing agency and deobligated by the requesting agency to the extent that 
the performing agency or unit filling the order has not (1) provided the goods or services (or incurred actual expenses in providing the goods or services), or (2)  entered i nto a contract with 
another entity to provide the requested goods or services  before the end of the period of availability 
(fiscal year or multiple year period, as applicable) of the appropriation of the requesting or ordering agency .  Expired funds must  not be available for new obligations. 
 5.7 Payment Procedures  (180507) 
  Payment must  be made promptly upon the written request (or billing) of the performing 
agency.  The payment due date must  not be more than 30 calendar days from the date of the invoice.  
Unless the DoD Component is specifically authorized by law, legislative action or Presidential authorization, funds are not to be advanced to non- DoD Federal entities, or  be used to pay for 
advance billings without the receipt of goods or services.  Volume 4, Chapter 5  cover s the 
conditions and requirements related to advances and prepayments.  For those few exceptions where DoD is specifically authorized by a specific app ropriation or law to advance funds, the specific 
appropriation or law authorizing the advance must be cited on the obligating and/or interagency agreement  documents and orders, and any unused amounts of the advance must be collected from 
the performing agency immediately and returned to the fund from which originally made.   5.7.1.  The requesting official must be fully aware of the non- DoD Federal agency’s billing 
practices and methods.  The official must also take appropriate action to ensure DoD funds are not disbursed in advance of contract performance.  Additionally, DoD Components must work with 
their servicing disbursement sites to ensure trading partner agreements restrict other Federal 
agencies’ ability to withdraw funds prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.  
2BDoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation  Volume 11A, Chapter 18  
* January 2020 
18-13  5.7.2.  Payments made for services rendered or goods furnished may be credited to the 
appropriation or fund of the Federal  agency per forming the reimbursable work. 
 * 5.7.3.  Volume 10, Chapter 10 contains the DoD policy for executing intragovernmental 
payments.  6.0 NON- ECONOMY ACT ORDER FOLLOW -UP PROCEDURES  (1806) 
 6.1 Non-Economy Act Order Oversight (180601) 
  The requesting official must establish quality surveillance plans, for non -Economy Act 
orders greater th an the simplified acquisition threshold, and ensure execution that would facilitate 
the oversight of the goods provided or services performed by the performing agency.  The plans should include:   6.1.1.  Contract administration oversight in accordance with the surveillance plan;   6.1.2.  Processes for receipt and review of receiving reports and invoices from the performing agency;   6.1.3.  Reconciliation of receiving reports and invoices; and   6.1.4.  Requirements for documenting acceptance of the goods received or services performed.  
 6.2 Monitor Fund Status (180602)   The requesting official must monitor fund status to:   6.2.1.  Monitor balances with the performing agency;   6.2.2.  Conduct Dormant Account Review Quarterly  (DAR -Q) of non- Economy Act orders 
in accordance with Volume 3, Chapter 8 and include a specific attestation on the DAR -Q that all 
existing interagency agreements  are consistent with DoD policy; 
  6.2.3.  Confirm open balances with the performing agency;   6.2.4.  Coordinate the return of funds from the non- DoD performing agency in accordance 
with paragraph 5.6; and  
  6.2.5.  Coordinate with the accounting office to ensure timely deobligation of funds.

* January 2020 
18-14 6.3 Non-Economy Act Order Close- Out (180603) 
 
 All non- Economy Act orders must  be reviewed by the requesting official to determine if 
they are complete.  Completed orders must  be fiscally closed out.  The requesting official must  
reconcile funds and coordinate the return of excess or expired funds held by the performing agency.  As part of this review, the requesting official will:   6.3.1.  Identify and determine if there are outstanding invoices;   6.3.2.  Identify and determine the existence of excess or expired funds;   6.3.3.  Coordinate the return of funds from the non -DoD perf orming agency in accordance 
with paragraph 5.6; and  
  6.3.4.  Coordinate with the accounting office to ensure the deobligation of funds.  *6.4 Reconciliation and Elimination of Intragovernmental Transactions (180604)  
  Volume 6B, Chapter 13 contains DoD policy and guidance for adjustments, eliminations, 
and other special intragovernmental reconciliation procedures.

DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES  
 
1.0 GENERAL  (1901) 
 1.1 Purpose (190101)   This chapter establishes financial policy for identifying, recording, reporting, and obtaining 
reimbursement for costs the Department of Defense (DoD) incurs in its role of providing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) in accordance with existing laws and policies  (see Addendum 
1).  DSCA refers to support provided by United States  (U.S.) Federal military for ces, DoD 
civilians, DoD contract personnel, DoD Component assets, and National Guard forces (when the Secretary of Defense (S ecDef), in coordination with the Governors of the affected States, elects 
and requests to use those forces in Title 32 U nited States Code (U.S.C.) status).  Typically, these 
elections  are in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for domestic emergencies, 
law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, or from qualifying entities for special events.   (DoD Directive (DoDD) 3025.18
). 
 1.2 Authoritative Guidance (190102)   1.2.1.  DoD has several primary missions, one of which is to defend the homeland and 
provide support to  civil authorities ( Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership:  Priorities for 21
st Century 
Defense, 2012).  In some instances, national defense assets may be made available to support civil authorities for disasters, emergencies, or other incidents.  DSCA is generally initiated by a request for DoD assistance from a Primary Agency (PA), such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  It is DoD policy that DSCA will be initiated by a request for DoD assistance 
from civil authorities or qualifying entities or is authorized by the President or SecDef.  All requests for DSCA support, with the exception of Immediate Response Authority (IRA), will be written, and will include a commitment to reimburse DoD in accordance with the Stafford Act, Economy Act, or other authorities.   1.2.2.  DoD may commit resources when approved by S ecDef or when directed by the 
President.   FEMA is responsible for coordinating Federal plans and programs for response to civil 
emergencies at the national and regional levels, and for Federal assistance to the States in civil emergencies.  In accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance 
Act ( 42 U.S.C. §§ 5121-5207
) (“Stafford Act”), in an emergency  or major disaster , the President 
may direct any Federal agency, with or without reimbursement, to utilize its authorities and resources granted under Federal law in support of State and local emergency assistance  and disaster response 
efforts .  A request for assistance (RFA ) is not valid until it is approved by S ecDef.  RFAs submitted 
by FEMA are also called mission assignments (MAs) , although they do not have directive effect 
until approved by SecDef.

* July 2015 
19-4 2.0 GENERAL  ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  (1902) 
 
 DSCA is provided on a cost reimbursable basis unless directed to  be provided on a 
non-reimbursable basis by the President or S ecDef or otherwise in accordance with the law .  
Requests for DSCA may be submitted in accordance with  the Stafford Act or under non- Stafford 
Act conditions.  2.1 Stafford Act  (190201) 
  2.1.1.  U nder the Stafford Act, the President may direct S ecDef to utilize DoD resources to 
help State and local governments respond to e mergencies and major disasters.  A Governor may 
request Federal assistance under the Stafford Act .  Once this request is received and it is certified 
in accordance with conditions in the Stafford Act, the President may make an emergency or major disaster declaration.  
  2.1.2.  The Stafford Act provides a system of emergency preparedness to protect life and 
property in the U .S. from hazards and to apportion responsibility for assistance in a disaster among 
the Federal G overnment, States, and their political subdivisions.  FEMA is the  primary Federal 
agency responsible for disaster relief efforts within the U.S. and administers assistance provided 
by the Stafford Act.  Federal departments and agencies, including DoD, support FEMA when requested by FEMA.  FEMA provides reimbursement for  the assistance requested  from disaster 
relief funds appropriated to FEMA for this purpose.  Federal departments and agencies may seek reimbursement from FEMA for eligible costs incurred during the performance of the requested 
support.  2.2 Non-Stafford Ac t (190202) 
  2.2.1.  A Federal entity with primary responsibility and statutory authority for handling an 
incident (i.e., the requesting agency) that needs support or assistance beyond its normal operations may request D epartment of Homeland S ecurity  coordination and facilitation through the 
National Response Framework
 (NRF).  Agencies providing disaster assistance under their own 
authorities independent of a Stafford Act declaration use their own appropriated mission funding.  DoD may provide assistance to other Federal  departments and agencies  by executing inter -agency 
reimbu rsable agreements with the requesting agency and request ing reimbursement from the 
requesting agency for eligible expenditures.  Generally, the requesting agency provides funding to DoD for the assistance requested  consistent with  the provisions of the Economy Act, unless other 
statutory authorities are available for this purpose.  
  2.2.2.  In response to a request for assistance from a civil authority under imminently serious conditions where time does not permit approval from higher authority, F ederal mi litary 
commanders, Heads of DoD Components, and/or responsible DoD civilian officials may  exercise 
immediate response authority in order to save lives, mitigate great property damage, and prevent 
human suffering.  (DoDD 3025.18).

* July 2015 
19-5 3.0 APPLICABILITY  (1903) 
 
 3.0.1.  This policy applies to Office of the S ecDef, the Military Departments, the Office of 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and the Joint Staff  (JS), the Combatant 
Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the D oD, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field 
Activities, and all other organizational entities within the DoD (hereafter referred to collectively 
as “DoD Components.”)  
   3.0.2.  This policy also applies to the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard (hereafter referred to collectively as the “National Guard”) personnel when under Federal 
command and control.  Also applies to National Guard personnel when S ecDef determines that it 
is appropriate to employ National Guard personnel in Title 32, U.S.C. status  to fulfill a request for 
DSCA.  S ecDef requests the concurrence of the Governors of the affected States, and those 
Governors concur in the employment of National Guard personnel in such a status. 
 4.0 SCOPE  (1904) 
  4.0.1.  This chapter promulgates DoD financial policy for emergency or disaster relief assistance when SecDef  approves a request for assistance to provide DoD support to other Federal 
departments or agencies under DoDD 3025.18.   4.0.2.  The Unified Command Plan assigns DSCA responsibilities to the Commander, U.S. 
Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) , within the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, 
Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and to the Commander , U.S. Pacific Command 
(USPACOM) , within Haw aii, U.S. territories or insular areas, and possessions in the USPACOM 
area of responsibility.  Commanders of Combatant Commands (CCDR s) with DSCA 
responsibilities and their Combatant Commands are referred to as “supported CCDRs” or 
“supported Combatant Commands,” respectively, throughout this policy.  5.0 DEFINITIONS  (1905) 
  Unless otherwise noted, these terms and their definitions are for the purposes of 
Volume 11A, C hapter  19. 
  5.01.  Defense Coordinating Officer (DCO) .  A DoD single point of contact for domestic 
emergencies.  Assigned to a joint field office to process requirements for military support, forward MAs through proper channels, and assign military liaisons as appropriate to activated emergency 
support functions.  ( Joint Publication 1 -06
). 
  5.0.2.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities  (DSCA).  Support provided by U.S. Federal 
military forces, DoD civilians, DoD contract personnel, DoD component assets, and National Guard forces (when S ecDef, in coordination with the Governors of the affected States, elects and 
requests to use those forces in Title 32, U .S.C., status) in response to requests for assistance from 
civil authorities for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, or from qualifying entities for special events. Also known as civil support.  ( DoDD 3025.18). 
DoD 7000.14-R                Financial Management Regulation      Volume 11A, Chapter 19  
* July 2015 
19-6  5.0.3.  Emergency.  Any incident, whether natural or manmade, that requires responsive 
action to protect life or property.  Under the Stafford Act, an emergency means any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the U .S.  
(42 U.S.C. § 5122). 
  5.0.4.  Immediate Response Authority (IRA).  A Federal military commander’s, DoD Component Head’s , and/or responsible DoD civilian official’s authority temporarily to employ 
resources under their  control, subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher 
headquarters .  Those resources are provided to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate 
great property damage .  This is typically  in response to a request for assistance from a civil 
authority, under imminently serious conditions when time does not permit approval from a higher authority within the U.S.   IRA does not perm it actions that would subject civilians to the use of 
military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory.  (DoDD 3025.18).   5.0.5.  National Response Framework (NRF).  This framework provides the principles by which response partners are to apply when providing a unified national response to disasters and emergencies.  It defines the key principles, roles, and structures by which communities, tribes, 
States, the Federal Government, and private -sector and nongovernmental partners apply these 
principles for a coordinated, effective national response.  The NRF is always in effect, and can be implemented at any level at any time.  
  5.0.6.  Mission Assignment (MA).  The mechanism used by FEMA  to support Federal 
operations in a Stafford Act major disaster or emergency declaration.  The MA orders immediate, short- term emergency response assistance when an applicable State or local government is 
overwhelmed by the event and lacks the capability to perform, or contract for, the necessary work. (NRF).  
  5.0.7.  Primary Agency (PA).  This describes a Federal agency with significant authorities, 
roles, resources, or capabilities for a particular function within an Emergency Support Function (ESF).  A Federal agency designated as an ESF PA  serves as a Federal Executive agent under the 
Federal Coordinating Officer (or Federal Resource Coordinator for non- Stafford Act incidents) to 
accomplish the ESF mission. (NRF).   5.0.8.  Principal Federal Official.   In Homel and Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-5
 
“Management of Domestic Incidents,” the President designated the Secretary of Homeland 
Security as the “principal Federal official” for domestic incident management and empowered the Secretary to coordinate Federal resources used in the prevention of, preparation for, response to, or recove ry from terrorist attacks, major disasters, or other emergencies, except for law 
enforcement responsibilities otherwise reserved to the Attorney General under HSPD-5.

* July 2015 
19-7  5.0.9.  Reimbursable Budget Authority (RBA) (also called reimbursable obligation 
authority).  Authority to incur obligations in accomplishing reimbursable work if a budgetary resource —either a reimbursable agreement from a Federal customer or an advance from a non -
Federal customer —is also available.   This authority can be acquired only by obtaining an allotment 
through the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) using an approved funding program process.  6.0 RESPONSIBILITIES  (1906) 
  Principal and supporting DoD participants in DSCA activities discussed throughout this 
chapter include, but are not limited to, S ecDef; the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Policy  (USD(P)), the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (USD(C)) ; CJCS; CCDR s; the 
JS; and DoD Components.   6.0.1.  S ecDef has overall authority for DoD and is the President’s principal advisor on 
matters concerning DSCA.  S ecDef retains approval authority for the use of forces, personnel, 
units, and equipment; has the primary responsibility within DoD to provide the overall policy and oversight for DSCA in the event of a domestic incident; and retains sole authority to waive reimbursement for DoD support.   6.0.2.  The USD(C) /Chief Financial Officer (C FO) establishes polic y and guidance to 
ensure timely reimbursement to DoD f or reimbursable DSCA activities, accounting and logistics 
codes to track an operation’s costs, billing procedures for reimbursable support, and any other financial management ( FM) instructions pertinent to the specific operation. 
  6.0.3.  The Heads of the DoD Components direct Component compliance with FM  
guidance related to support provided for DSCA operations, including guidance related to tracking costs and seeking reimbursement; and plan, program, and budget for DSCA capabilities in accordance with law , policy, and assigned missions.   
  6.0.4.  The Secretaries of the Military Departments direct that requests for reimbursement 
of actual DSCA expenditures (performance of work or services, payments to a contractor , or 
deliver y from inventory) begin within 30 calendar days after the month in which performance 
occurred.  Final billing invoices will be submitted to supported departments and agencies within 
90 calendar days of the termination of the supported event.   6.0.5.  The Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB), under the authority, direction, and 
control of S ecDef and the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force, will report the use of National 
Guard assets for DSCA when using Federal resources, equipment, and/or funding to the National 
Joint Operations and I ntelligence Center.  CNGB will ensure that the National Guard 
appropriations are appropriately reimbursed for DSCA activities.   6.0.6.  The  Joint Staff identifies resources available for support in response to DSCA 
requests and issues execute orders (EXORDs) to the appropriate CCDR with DSCA responsibilities in order to implement SecDef approved actions .   
 
DoD 7000.14-R                Financial Management Regulation      Volume 11A, Chapter 19  
* July 2015 
19-8  6.0.7.  The Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security  
(ASD(HD&GS )) serves as the principal civilian advisor to S ecDef and the USD(P)  on DSCA and 
coordinates DSCA policy with other Federal departments and agencies and the DoD Components 
as appropriate.  The ASD (HD&GS) also recommends the establishment of DoD policy regarding 
DSCA to the USD(P) .  The ASD(HD&GS) will ensure all requests for DoD assistance include 
provisions for reimbursement to DoD Components for capabilities provided.  ASD(HD&GS) will work with the USD(C), the JS, and the supported CCDR to ensure that DoD Components are reimbursed and will ensure that reimbursement is reported to SecDef at the completion of the support.    6.0.8.  CCDRs with DSCA Responsibilities.  In addition to the responsibilities in 
accordance with the Unified Command Plan, CCDR s with DSCA responsibilities will work 
closely with subordinate commands to ensure they are appropriately reimbursed for DSCA.  CCDRs with DS CA responsibilities provide command and control of DoD personnel and 
resources in Title 10 U.S.C. status and coordinate DSCA operations when directed by SecDef.  The supported CCDR will track the costs of support provided and ensure that the Military Departments and Services track costs and effect reimbursement.    6.0.9.  During a DSCA event, a PA such as FEMA may request assistance from DoD that, when approved by S ecDef, will be reimbursable under the appropriate authority, usually the 
Stafford Act  for FEMA.  The supported CCDR may provide assistance with the distribution, 
tracking, and management of RBA to performing DoD Component organizations.  A CCDR  may 
also task one of his or her  Components or activate a  Financial Management Augmentation Team  
(FMAT ) to manage RBA and close out the funding actions when support is completed (see 
Addendum 1).  6.1 Financial Management Augmentation Team (FMAT)  (190601) 
  The supported CCDR may establish an FMAT to assist in executing FM  duties during 
DSCA operations.  FMAT membership consists of experienced FM subject matter experts from 
each Service and major Defense Agency.  The supported CCDR, in his or her  oversight role of 
conducting D SCA activities , may utilize elements of the FMAT to participate in real- world events.  
FMAT members serve as a channel of communications  to their respective Services and Agencies, 
and help integrate the DSCA financial management processes into internal financial procedures and guidance.  FMAT members also participate in training and exercises with the supported Combatant Command and, if activated by the supported CCDR, will deploy to assist in conducting DSCA FM  tasks.  
 6.2 Federal Emergency Management Agen cy (FEMA)  (190602) 
  The Secretary of Homeland Security is the principal Federal official for domestic incident 
management.  Under Section 507 of the Homeland Security Act  of 2002, Public Law 107-296
, as 
amended, FEMA’s Administrator is delegated responsibility for administering the Stafford Act’s Federal assistance programs.  FEMA issues requests for assistance in the form of MAs (FEMA  Form 010-0-8).  MAs must contain appropriate information on funding and other 
managerial controls, such as funding obligation limits, for requested support.

* July 2015 
19-9 6.3 DSCA New Request s / Closure Certification  (190603) 
 
 The PA uses a RFA or FEMA MA to request goods and/or services from DoD for DSCA 
under the Economy Act or Stafford Act.  DSCA is ordinarily provided under an approved RFA  on 
a cost reimbursable basis unless otherwise directed by the President or reimbursement is waived by SecDef; and is closed when the DCO submits a closure certificate (A ddendum 2) to the PA. 
 6.4 Immediate Response Authority Support (190604)   Support provided under immediate response authority should be provided on a cost 
reimbursable basis, where appropriate or legally required, but support should not be delayed or denied based on the inability or unwillingness of the requester to make a commitment to reimburse DoD.  Oral requests for assistance in an emergency must be followed by a written request that includes an offer to reimburse DoD at the earliest available opp ortunity.  Support provided under 
immediate response authority will end when the necessity giving rise to the response is no longer present or when the approving DoD official or a higher authority directs an end to the response.  (DoDD 3025.18). 
 
7.0 FUNDING (1907) 
  Disaster relief participation is not a budgeted program for DoD.  Congress appropriates the 
Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FEMA ’s support to Federal and State Governments’ disaster relief 
efforts.  The DRF is available for purposes of the Stafford Act.  The Fund provides a no- year base 
against which FEMA can direct, coordinate, manage , and fund eligible response and recovery 
efforts that are associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm State 
resources.  DoD Components may be required to fund the costs of DSCA initially within existing resources, with the understanding that additional operating expenses may be reimbursed by the requesting agencies.  DRF funding for FEMA’s Stafford Act programs and disaster support activi ties falls into two categories: disaster relief cap adjustment and base/non -major disasters.  
 7.1 Disaster Relief Cap Adjustment (190701) 
  Funding under the disaster relief cap adjustment is for major disasters declared pursuant to 
the Stafford Act and designated by the Congress as being for disaster relief pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget Emergency Deficit Control Act (as amended by the 
Budget Control Act).  As a general rule, costs DoD incurs above its normal mission (i.e., incremental costs) are reimbursable by FEMA  out of funds provided for disaster relief in this 
category.  DoD Components must have processes in place to identify and record incremental costs 
to facilitate reimbursement as discussed in DoD FMR, Volume 3, Chapter 8.   
DoD 7000.14-R                Financial Management Regulation      Volume 11A, Chapter 19  
* July 2015 
19-10 7.2 Base/Non -Major Disasters (190702) 
 
 Funding under the base/non- major disasters category includes Emergencies, Pre -disaster 
Surge Support, Fire Management Assistance Grants , and activities that are non -disaster specific, 
such as Disaster Readiness Support activities (e.g., distribution center, reservist training).  
Pre-declaration requests for DoD support in response to disaster events are reimbursed to DoD on 
the basis of actual costs.  Generally, the requesting agency provides funding for the incident consistent with  the provisions of the Economy Act, unless other statutory authorities are available 
for this purpose.  The funding is not cost shared.  When an emergency requir es a response on 
behalf of DoD where there has not been a declaration of major disaster, this category of funding is used to reimburse DoD for actual expenses (i.e., full costs) incurred.  7.3 Other  (190703) 
  DRF funding is not available for activities un dertaken for incidents requiring a coordinated 
Federal response prior to the declaration of the disaster.  A  department or  agency that needs support 
or assistance beyond its normal operations may request PA coordination and facilitation through the NRF.  F ederal  departments and agencies may support each other by executing inter/intra -
agency reimbursable agreements in accordance with the Economy Act as discussed in 
Volume 11A, Chapter 3, or other applicable authorities.  8.0 REIMBURSEABLE SUPPORT (AGREEMENT)  (1908) 
  FM units provide the same or similar capabilities during DSCA operations as for other 
operations.  Authorities and funding are the main issues that affect  DoD’s ability to respond and 
provide DSCA.  Costs incurred during DSCA a  re reimbursable in accordance with the Economy 
Act and Stafford Act, unless otherwise directed by the President.  Cost reimbursement for DSCA  
usually occurs under  31 U.S.C. § 1535
 (commonly called the Economy Act), which mandates cost 
reimbursement by the Federal agency requesting support; or the Stafford Act, which sets the guidelines for reimbursements to Federal agencies and States from F ederal funds set aside to 
support missions in response to a Presidential declaration.  Components should seek reimbursement for any DSCA support provided under the Economy or Stafford Acts.  DSCA suppor t provided under immediate response authority to non- Federal agencies is  reimbursed to the 
U.S. Treasury in accordance with  
31 U.S.C. § 9701 .  DSCA support provided under immediate 
response authority to Federal agencies is  reimbursed to DoD organizations in accordance with 
31 U.S.C. § 1535.  
 8.1 Advances  (190801) 
  Advance payments to DoD from the DRF are generally not authorized but may be 
necessary where DoD Components do not have sufficient funds remaining to provide the requested capability/support to the PA prior to end of the fiscal year.

19-11 8.2 Expenditures Eligible for Reimbursement (190802) 
  Title 44, C ode of F ederal Regulation s, part  206.8
 provides for reimbursement of costs DoD 
incurs in providing requested assistance.  Under the Economy Act and Stafford Act, only S ecDef 
has the authority to waive reimbursement.  Examples of expenditures that may be eligible for reimbursement include:  
  8.2.1.  Overtime, travel, and per diem of permanent Federal agency personnel.    8.2.2.  Wages, travel, and per diem of temporary Federal agency personnel assigned solely for performance of services directed in the major disaster or emergency area.    8.2.3.  Travel and per diem of Federal military personnel assigned solely for the performance of services directed in the major disaster or emergency area.    8.2.4.  Cost of work, services, and materials procured under contract for the purposes of providing direc ted assistance.  
  8.2.5.  Cost of materials, equipment, and supplies (including transportation, repair, and maintenance) from regular stocks used in providing directed assistance.    8.2.6.  All costs incurred that  are paid from trust, revolving, or other funds, and whose 
reimbursement is required by law.    8.2.7.  Other costs submitted by DoD with written justification or otherwise agreed to in writing by the PA.   8.3 Requirements for Reimbursement  (190803) 
  DoD Components performing work under an approved RFA will submit requests for 
reimbursement as prescribed in SecDef -approved and USNORTHCOM standing DSCA 
EXORDs.  (FEMA MAs must also comply with FEMA’s Mission Assignment Billing and Reimbursement  FEMA Checklist
.)  Reimbursement requests will cite the specific approved RFA 
/MA under which the work was performed and the major disaster or emergency identification number. 
  8.3.1.  R equests for reimbursement of costs incurred under more than one order may not 
be combined for billing purposes.  Components requesting reimbursement will retain all financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records pertinent to the provision of services or use of resources by the Department.  
  8.3.2.  Reimbursement requests must be reviewed by a Component official familiar with 
the original approved RFA so that chargebacks  resulting from reimbursement requests that are not 
within the scope of the original request are properly adjusted.   
DoD 7000.14-R                Financial Management Regulation      Volume 11A, Chapter 19  
* July 2015 
19-12  8.3.3.  When deployed to the supported Combatant Command in response to an approved 
RFA, all units must report financial management infor mation to the supported Combatant 
Command, or its designee, until the order is closed; regardless of when the unit redeploys from the supported Combatant Command .  The approved RFA is closed when the DCO submits a closure 
certificate to the PA  (see Addendum 1). 
 8.4 Supporting Documentation (190804)   Approved RFA (or MA) requests for reimbursement must include supporting 
documentation.   8.4.1.  Each Component is responsible for maintaining supporting documentation for all 
obligations and outlays and other costs incurred (see paragraph 190903.A.), including:    8.4.1.1.  Copy of approved RFA form and identification of order number on other 
documentation;     8.4.1.2.  Breakdown of costs by sub- object class code (see OMB Circular A -11
) 
and cost breakdown structure (CBS) code (see Volume 2A, Chapter 3); 
   8.4.1.3.  Description of services performed ; 
   8.4.1.4.  Period of Performance;    8.4.1.5.  Personnel Services : 
    8.4.1.5.1.  Regular or overtime labor with breakdown of hours;     8.4.1.5.2.  Indirect  cost (percentage, description of costs included in cost 
pool);    8.4.1.6.  Travel/Per Diem and Transportation ; 
   8.4.1.7.  Contract Services (contract number, name, cost, purpose);    8.4.1.8.  Property/Equipment Purchase, provide the following information:     8.4.1.8.1.  Expendable Property, separate identification not required ; 
    8.4.1.8.2.  Non -expendable property or sensitive items, separate 
identification is  required , including description of item, vendor name, unit cost, and serial number 
or other unique identification; and  
    8.4.1.8.3.  Verification of disposition for items listed in subparagraph 8.4.1.8.2.

19-13  8.4.2.  Records Retention.  Volume 1, Chapter 9 provides document retention requirements 
applicable to Federal entities  in the Title 44, United States Code and the National Archives and 
Records Administration General Records Schedule 6.  The DoD has also developed supplementary 
guidance in DoD Directive 5015.2, “DoD Records Management Program” and Volume 1, Chapter  9.  DoD  Components will comply with their own Records Management policies.  
Questions regarding records retention shall be directed to each Component’s DoD appointed Federal Records Officer ( Federal Records Officers
). 
  8.4.3.  Citing the Appropriation.  DoD Components receiving reimbursement from the PA for goods and services furnished under the provisions of the Stafford Act are to credit such funds to the appropriation used to make such expenditures that are available for obligation on the date of the reimbursement.  Each DoD Component involved in DSC A has a responsibility to:  
   8.4.3.1.  Maintain  documentation to support requests for reimbursement;  
   8.4.3.2.  Identify a staff -level point of contact for financial coordination with the 
PA and identify a headquarters -level point of contact for billing and reimbursement issues that 
cannot be resolved at the staff level;  
   8.4.3.3.  Notify the requesting activity (e.g., FEMA) when a task is completed;     8.4.3.4.  Apply proper financial principles, policies, regulations, and management and internal controls to ensure full accountability for the expenditure of DRF funds;    8.4.3.5.
