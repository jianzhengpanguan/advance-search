Immigration – The White House 
President Trump kept his promise to build a wall on our southern border between the United States and Mexico. With 450 miles complete—and many more in progress—illegal crossings plummeted over 87 percent in areas where the wall went up. 
 
By enforcing America’s immigration laws, President Trump made major gains toward ending the humanitarian crisis at our border; keeping criminals, terrorists, and drugs out of our country; and protecting American workers and taxpayers against job loss and misuse of the welfare system.

Built over 400 miles of the world’s most robust and advanced border wall 
 
Illegal crossings have plummeted over 87 percent where the wall has been constructed 
 
Deployed nearly 5,000 troops to the Southern border. In addition, Mexico deployed tens of thousands of their own soldiers and national guardsmen to secure their side of the U.S.–Mexico border 
 
Ended the dangerous practice of Catch-and-Release, which means that instead of aliens getting released into the United States pending future hearings never to be seen again, they are detained pending removal, and then ultimately returned to their home countries 
 
Entered into three historic asylum cooperation agreements with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to stop asylum fraud and resettle illegal migrants in third-party nations pending their asylum applications 
 
Entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, referred to as the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” to safely return asylum-seekers to Mexico while awaiting hearings in the United States 
 
Signed an executive order to strip discretionary Federal grant funding from deadly “sanctuary” cities 
 
Fully enforced and implemented statutorily authorized “expedited removal” of illegal aliens 
 
The Department of Justice prosecuted a record-breaking number of immigration-related crimes 
 
Used Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to reduce the number of aliens coming from countries whose governments refuse to accept their nationals who were ordered removed from the United States 
 
Ended asylum fraud, shut down human smuggling traffickers, and solved the humanitarian crisis across the Western Hemisphere 
 
Suspended, via regulation, asylum for aliens who had skipped previous countries where they were eligible for asylum but opted to “forum shop” and continue to the United States 
 
Safeguarded migrant families, and protected migrant safety, by promulgating new regulations under the Flores Settlement Agreement 
 
Proposed regulations to end the practice of giving free work permits to illegal aliens lodging meritless asylum claims 
 
Issued “internal relocation” guidance 
 
Cross-trained United States Border Patrol agents to conduct credible fear screenings alongside United States Citizenship and Immigration Services adjudication personnel to reduce massive backlogs 
 
Streamlined and expedited the asylum hearing process through both the Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR) and the Humanitarian Asylum Review Process (HARP) 
 
Launched the Family Fraud Initiative to identify hundreds of individuals who were fraudulently presenting themselves as family units at the border—oftentimes by trafficking children—in order to protect child welfare 
 
Improved screening in countries with high overstay rates and reduced visa overstay rates in many of these countries 
 
Removed bureaucratic constraints on United States consular officers that reduced their ability to appropriately vet visa applicants 
 
Worked with Mexico and other regional partners to dismantle the human smuggling networks in our hemisphere that profit from human misery and fuel the border crisis by exploiting vulnerable populations 
 
Instituted national security travel bans to keep out terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists, and implemented a uniform security and information-sharing baseline that all nations must meet in order for their nationals to be able to travel and emigrate to the United States 
 
Suspended refugee resettlement from the world’s most dangerous and terror-afflicted regions 
 
Rebalanced refugee assistance to focus on overseas resettlement and burden-sharing 
 
85 percent reduction in refugee resettlement 
 
Overhauled badly broken refugee security screening process 
 
Required the Department of State to consult with states and localities as part of the Federal government’s refugee resettlement process 
 
Issued strict sanctions on countries that have failed to take back their own nationals 
 
Established the National Vetting Center, which is the most advanced and comprehensive visa screening system anywhere in the world 
 
Issued a comprehensive “public charge” regulation to ensure newcomers to the United States are financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare 
 
Created an enforcement mechanism for sponsor repayment, deeming to ensure that people who are presenting themselves as sponsors are actually responsible for sponsor obligations 
 
Issued regulations to combat the horrendous practice of “birth tourism” 
 
Issued a rule with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make illegal aliens ineligible for public housing 
 
Issued directives requiring Federal agencies to hire United States workers first and prioritize the hiring of United States workers wherever possible 
 
Suspended the entry of low-wage workers that threaten American jobs 
 
Finalized new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of United States workers and modify the administrative tools that are required for H-1B visa issuance 
 
Defended United States sovereignty by withdrawing from the United Nations’ Global Compact on Migration 
 
Suspended Employment Authorization Documents for aliens who arrive illegally between ports of entry and are ordered removed from the United States 
 
Restored integrity to the use of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) by strictly adhering to the statutory conditions required for TPS
