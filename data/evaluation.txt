Trump argued that the agreement would disadvantage the U.S. by allowing other countries to gain a financial advantage.
* However, many economic analyses and expert opinions suggest that the Paris Agreement could foster economic opportunities through the advancement of new technologies and industries related to renewable energy and sustainability. Thus, the claim is largely labeled as fiction because it overlooks potential economic benefits and focuses predominantly on speculative disadvantages.

* Economic impacts of environmental accords can vary widely based on industries, time frames, and enforcement of regulations; however, the lacking substantial empirical evidence from both articles makes the “detrimental impact” aspect lean more towards fiction or at least an unverified claim.
